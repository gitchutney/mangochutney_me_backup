			 <p>Sitting at a car dealership, getting a few things fixed and modified on my Forester. They just handed me a cup of coffee. Someone here really enjoys good ☕️ because not only is it not terrible (as you&rsquo;d expect), it&rsquo;s tasty and strong as heck. I&rsquo;m having my butt whooped.</p>

			 <p>Late in summer of 2021 I stumbled across a 1996 Trek MultiTrack in almost mint condition on a classifieds site. The seller was running a small business on the side, finding really nice, old bikes in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, cleaning them, repairing what needs repairing and reselling them at a decent mark-up.</p>

<p>The frame is aluminium made for Trek by Easton and welded in the USA. The fork is a CroMo fork with full-width reinforced rack eyelets. Both painted in a beautiful metallic bordeaux red. All original parts were from Trek&rsquo;s in-house accessory brand (before Bontrager) and the groupset was full Shimano STX RC (including the wheels).</p>

<p>I immediately fell in love with this bike and after I picked it up from the seller at Lake Constance, it was fitted with a pair of SKS Bluemels Long fenders and a period-appropriate rear rack.</p>

<p>After riding it happily for a few months, I made some changes to my stable of bikes and with some inspiration from The Radavist and Bikepacking.com—typical cyclist, I know—I got it into my head that I could turn this into a retro mod that would be appropriate not only for really quick runs to the supermarket but also for day rides when I don&rsquo;t need one of my more performance-oriented bikes. I checked what I had laying around in terms of componentry, made a list of stuff I&rsquo;d need and got searching.<br />
I have to admit that it did feel like sacrilege swapping all of those perfectly good old components but I&rsquo;m very happy with the result (and I&rsquo;m not giving them away, so if I ever decide to sell the bike again, I&rsquo;ll likely install them again).</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2022/6f3a087bc6.jpg" alt="Retro-mod of a 1996 Trek MultiTrack rigid trekking MTB with a Croozer dog trailer attached. The bike and trailer are standing on a grassy path alongside a green field, in front of a slightly hazy mountain vista."></p>

<p>List of changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>680 mm wide (25.4 mm clamp diametre) Reserve handlebars (new, stripped the logos)</li>
<li>Higher stem (bought used)</li>
<li>Spurcycle bell, black (new – none of my bikes feels complete without one)</li>
<li>SRAM GX Eagle group + NX Eagle HG cassette (bought used)</li>
<li>Rotor Aldhu cranks + Rotor oval 34t chainring (bought used and got it surprisingly cheap)</li>
<li>Magura HS33 hydro rim brakes (new)</li>
<li>Specialized Pizza Rack (bought used)</li>
<li>DT Swiss rims (32 spokes, 19 mm internal width) with Shimano XT hubs front and rear (bought used, almost mint condition and got them for a really good price)</li>
<li>Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700×38c (used) on Tubolito tubes (also used)</li>
</ul>

<p>The bike rides really well and with the very low gearing, lugging the doggy trailer up one of many hills in the area is quite doable. The rims are excellent and braking performance with the HS33 is incredible.</p>

			 <p>Dear fellow men, please stop being whiny dicks. People with vaginas have periods. They&rsquo;re a thing. Not disgusting or unclean. Believe me, most women are more annoyed by them than you could possibly be.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2022/0512317e7a.jpg" alt="AITA for "forcing" my husband to sleep on the couch: This conflict is pretty recent. I (f29) used to use tampons for my periods but due to medical reasons couldn't do it anymore. now I'm using pads which isn't that big of a deal but my husband disagrees. He firstly complained about me not "consulting" him first but like I said it's not a huge deal like BC. He then said he doesn't feel comfortable with me sleeping in bed wearing pads. this threw me off hard because I wasn't expecting him to have an issue on that regard, but he said it just doesn't feel comfortable for him and he would like me to use tampons at nighttime or sleep somewhere else. I laughed him off and kept sleeping on the bed while wearing my pads like there was no issue. This made him so uncomfortable he basically took the couch then started complaining about how I forced him on the couch by making him uncomfortable after he already offered me compromises. but I told him he was being a drama queen because his compromises are illogical, I wouldn't stop using pads and free bleed on the bed nor risk my health and use tampons when the doctor advised again them. he's still upset with me even though I'm no longer on my period saying I owe him for making him uncomfortable and brushing off his complaints." /></p>

			 <p>With WWDC coming, I was about to write another post clamouring, pleading, even begging for a macOS tablet or iPadOS becoming less of a limiting factor for the applications it runs. I like macOS and iPadOS mostly and the app ecosystem for Apple&rsquo;s operating systems is hard to beat. Yet not a day goes by that I don&rsquo;t wish I could perform certain tasks on my iPad Pro that I can do on my MacBook Pro, or interact with content on my MacBook Pro&rsquo;s screen by touching it, or just grabbing the disply to read something in portrait mode.</p>

<p>Instead of writing that article again, I finally broke down and ordered a ThinkPad X12 Detachable.</p>

<p>I hesitated taking the plunge because</p>

<ul>
<li>the hardware is well over a year old already,</li>
<li>the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 exists and is better in many ways (higher-resolution display, better colour reproduction, two Thunderbolt 4 ports) and</li>
<li>devices of this class with Intel&rsquo;s new Alder Lake architecture are right around the corner.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s always the issue, though, right? Something new and better is always around the corner. In the end, I decided to go for it because</p>

<ul>
<li>I found a demonstration unit in supposedly &ldquo;as good as new&rdquo; condition for a decent price with a lot of warranty still in place,</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for the ThinkPad design language,</li>
<li>the display is going to be good enough for my use (as good as the iPad Pro display in terms of colour reproduction),</li>
<li>it has LTE built-in,</li>
<li>and I&rsquo;m definitely going to enjoy the keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting finding Windows alternatives to my favourite and most-used applications from both macOS and iPadOS.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some time two weeks ago, yet another story of the Harry Potter author publicly supporting something hateful aimed at the transgender community was reported on. This finally had me grab all Harry Potter books from my shelves, put them in a cardboard box, tape the box shut and put it away.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Mf9LHZH/0/49c32741/X4/i-Mf9LHZH-X4.jpg" alt="" title="Closeup of a wooden bookshelf with the Harry Potter Books in visible in three languages, a Marauder's Map in front of the books, with two wand from the film franchise on top of it. To the right the Knight Bus from the movies in LEGO form and various other bits and pieces of merchandise on top of the books." /></p>

<p>The Harry Potter books have meant a lot to me. I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve read them or listened to the Stephen Fry-narrated audiobooks. Hell, the books became so familiar to me that I bought them in various languages to aid me in learning. The franchise has been a point of connection with a number of friends. References from and memes based on content from the books and movies will be forever burned into my brain.</p>

<p>But over the past few years, I found it hard to look at the books without a painful pang, robbing me of the joy I typically felt when thinking of the stories. The author&rsquo;s decision to propagate transphobia has tainted my relationship with the Harry Potter books for a long time, and it was, in all honesty, mixed with a fair amount of shame because I didn&rsquo;t catch <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it">the various bits of transphobic drivel in her Cormoran Strike novels</a>, at a time where I had believed myself to be more sensitive to those topics already.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I didn&rsquo;t quite understand why that was, why I wasn&rsquo;t able to separate Rowling from Harry Potter, when I&rsquo;ve separated the art from the artist in other cases. Now I believe I finally got it:</p>

<p>J.K. Rowling is intentionally, actively, violently transphobic. She uses her gigantic platform to propagate hate and props up others who want to see transgender people hurt and excluded from society. By all appearances she revels in spreading an ideology devoid of tolerance and humanity.</p>

<p>This, combined with how much I love(d) the Harry Potter franchise, is the reason why I can&rsquo;t continue to blissfully enjoy the books. With Rowling it&rsquo;s not accidental ignorance, it&rsquo;s her desire to cause pain and endanger transgender persons.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t expect her to change her behaviour, to stop causing pain, but I can fill the space on the shelf with books from other authors.</p>

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2022/01/11/sachmangelhaftung-bei-privatverkufen.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-11 09:24:00 &#43;0100">Jan 11, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Seit dem 1. Januar 2022 gelten in Deutschland neue gesetzliche Vorschriften hinsichtlich der Sachmängelhaftung bei Privatverkäufen. Da ich aktuell viele gebrauchte Dinge im Netz verkaufe und mir nie sicher war, welche Formulierung einen Haftungsausschluss darstellt und wie ich klar machen kann, dass Rücknahme und Umtausch ausgeschlossen sind, habe ich mich auf die Suche gemacht und wurde relativ schnell in diesem Artikel von Stiftung Warentest fündig: <a href="https://www.test.de/Verkauf-im-Internet-Haftung-ausschliessen-als-Verkaeufer-4533698-0/">Privatverkauf im Internet — Haftung ausschließen als Verkäufer</a></p>

<p>Die Quintessenz ist, dass bei mehrfachen Verkäufen von Gebrauchtware nur die folgende Formulierung einen wirksamen Haftungsausschluss darstellt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ich schließe jegliche Sach­mängelhaftung aus.
Die Haftung auf Schaden­ersatz wegen Verletzungen von Gesundheit, Körper oder Leben und grob fahr­lässiger und/oder vorsätzlicher Verletzungen meiner Pflichten als Verkäufer bleibt uneinge­schränkt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wichtig hierbei ist eine genaue Beschreibung des Artikels und eventueller Makel und Mängel, sonst haftet der Verkäufer weiterhin.</p>

<p>Interessant ist auch—und das wusste ich nicht—dass bei Privatverkäufen grundsätzlich kein Recht auf Rücknahme, Minderungen, und Umtausch besteht. Ich denke ich werde dies aber weiterhin dazu schreiben.</p>

			 <p>The more things I try with this bike the more I like it. It&rsquo;s so versatile and dependable.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago it was a touring bike, lately it&rsquo;s been my commuter, and now I&rsquo;ve prepared it for a gravel rallye. 🚲</p>

			 <p>Wired: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/actually-gender-neutral-pronouns-can-change-a-culture/">Actually, Gender-Neutral Pronouns Can Change a Culture</a></p>

<p>Using the example of how the gender-neutral word &ldquo;hen&rdquo; changed perception and culture in Sweden, the authors of the article go through various issue that exist with making gender-neutral language the default.</p>

<p>As I read the article, I realised how much the use of the singular <em>they/them</em> is ingrained in my vocabulary at this point, thanks to amazing friends and colleagues who helped me educate myself on this topic.<br />
It also made me wonder how I handle this in German, my native language.</p>

<p>I speak English every day and for a living. It makes using gender-neutral pronouns and more inclusive language easy; with the exception of androcentric words, gender typically doesn&rsquo;t seep into the nouns themselves, unlike in German.</p>

<p>Thinking about this a bit, I tend to avoid pronouns in writing and speaking whenever possible but it can lead to less elegant and sometimes downright unwieldy sentences.</p>

<p>It led me down a rabbit hole filled with lots of variations of the same question on popular question/answer platforms &ldquo;Wie kann they/them im Deutschen erwendet werden?&rdquo; (How can they/them be used in German?) and eventually to a section in a German Wikipedia article on the topic, which was pretty good as an overview: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichtbinäre_Geschlechtsidentität#Das_singulare_Pronomen_„they“">Nicht-binäre Geschlechtsindentität - Das singuläre Pronomen &ldquo;they&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The recommendations from various institutions and entities listed there are pretty good starting points but something about the use of neopronouns in German doesn&rsquo;t yet manage to penetrate my skull. In the latest season of Star Trek: Discovery, there&rsquo;s an amazing non-binary character and in the English audio, they/them is used. In German the translators went with &ldquo;dey/dem&rdquo; and it felt jarring to my ears. <a href="https://www.annaheger.de/darunterdarueber/">Illi Anna Heger published a broader discussion of this topic</a>, highlighting various examples of German translations of they/them in German synchronisations and subtitles. Really worth a read.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m intensely curious which pronouns are going to become established norm for gender-neutral language in German and Im glad to see that even <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/lufthansa-spricht-kuenftig-genderneutral-an-bord-17435200.html">large organisations are starting to attempt using more inclusive language in their daily business</a>. It would definitely be nice for an institution like the <a href="https://www.duden.de/suchen/dudenonline/Xier">Duden</a> (think: Merriam Webster in Germany) to throw their weight behind one of the neopronouns.</p>

			 <p>Utterly great comedian Tiff Stevenson last week had <a href="https://pod.link/Tiny/episode/1d6b8f6fc5e222d3a1f80ad15cf7ff6f">had Andy Zaltzman</a> on her podcast, where she interviews various comedians and artists about the tiny revolutions in their lives. The conversation these two had is brilliant and features a lot of history of <a href="https://thebuglepodcast.com">The Bugle</a>, which has been my favourite podcast for almost 13 years.</p>

<p>I honestly find it hard to express how much joy The Bugle has brought me. I first found it by accident in late 2008 when I was in a bit of a stand up comedy show discovery phase while studying in Beijing. It popped up in the recommendations in Apple Podcasts and after the first listen, I was hooked.</p>

<p>When John Oliver left because, as Andy tells it, it just wasn&rsquo;t possible to do <a href="https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Last Week Tonight</a> and a weekly transatlantic podcast, I was gutted and very sad but obviously kept listening.
The reimagined show, where Andy is joined by two correspondents every week, has been, in my opinion, the best thing that could&rsquo;ve happened. I&rsquo;d still love to see John Oliver return every now and then but the roster of people Andy is bringing on from around the world, all of them with their own perspectives, is hard to beat.</p>

<p>I was introduced to so many extremely funny comics: first and foremost <a href="http://www.alicecomedyfraser.com">Alice Fraser</a>, as well as (and in no particular order) <a href="https://tiffstevenson.co.uk">Tiff Stevenson</a>, <a href="https://www.nishkumar.co.uk">Nish Kumar</a>, <a href="http://aditimittal.com">Aditi Mittal</a>, <a href="http://www.joshgondelman.com">Josh Gondleman</a>, <a href="https://anuvabpal.com">Anuvab Pal</a>, <a href="https://charliegeorgecomedy.com">Charlie George</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesNokise">James Nokise</a>, <a href="https://www.felicityward.com">Felicity Ward</a>, <a href="http://alisonspittle.com">Alison Spittle</a>, and many, many more.</p>

<p>There are alerady two spin-offs, both hosted by Alice Fraser:<br />
<a href="https://pod.link/Gargle">The Gargle</a>, in which Alice and guests tackle anything that isn&rsquo;t political news, and <a href="https://pod.link/thelastpost">The Last Post</a>, The Bugle from a parallel universe.</p>

<p>If you like satire, sillyness, and can handle puns, check out The Bugle and its sister shows. I&rsquo;ll see you again in about 9 months, once you reemerge from the binge cave. 😁</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2021/06/22/fun-mostly-gravel.html">Fun (mostly) gravel ride, even if I didn&#39;t complete the 100 miles 🚲</a></h1>

			 <p>I tried myself at an imperial century (100 miles) along the Rhine but had to admit defeat about 100 km into the ride. The weather was brilliant and brilliantly hot and humid. Instead of pushing myself too hard, I decided to veer off to the east and head to the next station to catch a train back home.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DDwNLjc/0/7d55fe59/4K/i-DDwNLjc-4K.jpg" alt="" title="Green wheat fields in the foreground and low rolling hills in the background in harsh sunlight with a lot of haze." /></p>

<p>The gravel along the Rhine is perfection; small pebbles and dust. It was easy to find a good cadence and just glide along.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-dqdB2hW/0/02288bc0/4K/i-dqdB2hW-4K.jpg" alt="" title="Light brown gravel road flanked by grass and low shrubs, heading into the distance. To the left the river Rhine. On the far ends left and right, the river and road are flanked by trees." /></p>

<p>In places the water meadows along the Rhine reminded me of a bike ride I did in the Everglades, which felt very strange.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-NdwLwNf/0/9ece496f/4K/i-NdwLwNf-4K.jpg" alt="" title="Laden titanium gravel bike covered in dust, leaning against the wood and steel railing of a concrete bridge over one of the interconnected lakes of the Rhine water meadows. The meadow lakes are surrounded by trees." /></p>

<p>This was also my first attempt at finding out what works for me in terms of gear and bike setup for longer outdoor rides.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wfKJ9Q2/0/feb60223/4K/i-wfKJ9Q2-4K.jpg" alt="" title="Full close-up of a very dusty titanium gravel bike leaning against the wooden wall of a bus stop." /></p>

<ul>
<li>Basic drivetrain setup was 46/30 gearing in the front, an 11–30 cassette in the back. This was perfect and the tight gear spacing in the higher gears allowed me to find the optimal cadence almost all the time.</li>
<li>The tyres (WTB Nano 40) were overkill. I wanted to ride on my other wheelset shod with the Specialized Sawtooth 700×38c but I found two loose spokes on each wheel two days before and couldn&rsquo;t have them checked out before the ride. Went with my more roudy wheelset because I simply didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of swapping tubeless tyres for this ride. This slowed me down considerably on roads but on the other hand made for very comfortable, dare I say <em>supple</em>, riding on gravel.</li>
<li>I brought 2.5 l of water, knowing that I&rsquo;d be able to refill along the way and I was happily surprised that the bottle carrier attachment on the Specialized saddle held up even over rougher sections. That said, the titanium cages let go off my bottles twice. I think for this holder, I&rsquo;ll need cages that have their opening to the side.</li>
<li>The Muc-Off dry lube that I put on the chain held up really well but I should&rsquo;ve taken some with me, because by kilometer 80 it was pretty much gone.</li>
<li>The aero arm rest (the ridiculously named Profile Design &ldquo;Airstryke&rdquo;) was such a good choice for this ride, even despite my doofidity of not getting my body reacquainted with this riding position before attempting a 100+ km tour. Still, the ambundance of hand and body positions was definitely welcome.</li>
<li>The first generation Hammerhead Karoo worked perfectly as always. This thing continues to impress.</li>
<li>The two bags I&rsquo;ve used (both from Road Runner Bags) did their job and I think I&rsquo;ve packed well.I should&rsquo;ve brought more snacks for this ride, both sweet and savoury. I didn&rsquo;t encounter nearly enough shops and restaurants along the route I had built.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end I rode 122 km. Just ~ 7 km shy of the 129 km I pedaled during the Zwift Uber Pretzel virtual ride earlier this year. I was properly exhausted after but not completely destroyed, which made me happy.<br />
Once temperatures cool down a bit, I&rsquo;ll try the 100 miles again. I think all the reading I&rsquo;ve done on <a href="https://bikepacking.com">Bikepacking.com</a>, <a href="https://theradavist.com">The Radavist</a>, and <a href="https://www.gravelcyclist.com">Gravel Cyclist</a> has had me pretty well prepared and the only things I&rsquo;ll have to change before the next ride are going to be the tyres and the amount of snacks I bring for this route.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s what happened so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I sold my CX-bike-turned-commuter a few months ago because its aluminium frame didn&rsquo;t deal well with dragging a laden dog trailer.</li>
<li>At roughly the same time, I bought an old and beautiful titanium MTB as a daily beater. The 120 mm stem and 540 mm wide handlebars felt supremely weird.</li>
<li>Fitted the MTB with a shorter stem and moderately wide, 680 mm handlebars. That did the trick and the frankly over-engineered frame is much, much stiffer and has no problems when pulling the trailer.</li>
<li>Side effect: I&rsquo;ve been spending more time on a flat bar bike again and even though the overall geometry of the MTB is closer to my gravel bike than any remotely modern MTB, it still rides completely differently. And it&rsquo;s fun. Damn.</li>
<li>For a few weeks I&rsquo;ve been alternating between the gravel bike and the MTB on similar rides. This had me remember how much I enjoyed the MTB riding position back in my youth. Damn again.</li>
<li>But holy baloney, rim brakes are crap for challenging terrain. Even the top notch hydraulic ones on that thing. People did downhill with rim brakes?!?</li>
<li>Started researching modern MTBs. Slack head tube angles and steep seat angles make for a bike that descends well and climbs well, you say? <em>Interesting.</em></li>
<li>That <a href="https://bikepacking.com/bikes/nordest-sardinha-review/">Nordest Sardinha II</a> does look nice and seems to fit the bill. Not a rowdy enduro bike but theoretically more capable than a XC bike. So many mounts. This could be a blast for touring and confidence inspiring for the more technical rides I like to do. It&rsquo;s steel and not titanium but maybe I can deal.</li>
<li>Ah well, I didn&rsquo;t have time to configure a complete bike anyway and I lack knowledge to gauge the suitability of MTB wheels and forks to build it up without braking the bank.</li>
<li>Oh look, someone sells a Sardinha II in my size with everything but the saddle, pedals, and shift group. <em>Checks spare parts cupboard.</em> Yup, all here. Damn for a third time.</li>
<li>Bought it.</li>
<li>But what about the other bikes? Do I really need 4 bikes?</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s see where this goes and maybe I&rsquo;ll sell the old MTB and the road bike. The gravel bike should be able to do road just fine with the right tyres and cassette, right? Right? Where did I put that set of WTB Exposure 30 again?</li>
</ol>

<p>So this is where I&rsquo;m at.<br />
I have a black Nordest Sardinha II standing behind me. Fitted it with a dropper post, my SRAM XO1 Eagle group, and I&rsquo;m just waiting for a different front tyre and some small parts before I head out for the first ride on one of my go-to routes around here to see if this something I can see myself riding again.</p>

<p>The gravel bike will see its wheel sets changed up a bit: The WTB Nano 40 pneus will come off, to be replaced by the Exposure 30 and tubes for road riding. The 11–40 cassette will be swapped for either the 9–39 or the 11–32 I have in my workshop.</p>

<p>The Specialized Pathfinder Pro will stay on the second set of DT Swiss CR1600 wheels but fitted with tubes because I damaged one of the tyres in a way that tubeless sealant can&rsquo;t fix. For typical gravel riding in dry conditions, these tyres are super capable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be an interesting riding season.</p>

			 <p>Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve been looking at potential alternatives to Adobe Photoshop Lightroom for my RAW processing and photo editing needs. It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s a lot wrong with Lightroom, really. I&rsquo;ve been using the applications, particularly those on iOS with satisfaction. With the renewal of my annual subscription coming up, I wanted to see what else is out there, at this point.</p>

<p>A few friends and acquaintances helped me with some recommendations and I took time to test them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.captureone.com/en/products-plans/single-user/capture-one-for-fujifilm">Capture One Fujifilm</a></strong> surprised me with a decent UI and a significantly better rendering of Fujifilm RAF files than Lightroom. I&rsquo;d read about that but didn&rsquo;t think the difference would be this stark. Adobe should really do their homework there. Sadly, the macOS app was <em>slow</em>, slower than Lightroom. While that was disappointing, the complete lack of an iOS application disqualified it for me.</li>
<li>Next up, I gave <strong><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en/photo/">Affinity Photo</a></strong> a try and this app really shone for a number of reasons, including a very responsive user interface. The RAW renderer wasn&rsquo;t as good for Fujifilm files as Lightroom&rsquo;s, though. But the more important reason why I didn&rsquo;t go deeper into it was the fact that this application is simply too much for my needs. It&rsquo;s much closer to Photoshop than to Lightroom or Aperture (R.I.P Aperture 😢) and that&rsquo;s overkill for me.</li>
<li>The last one in the pack, <strong><a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/photo/">Pixelmator Photo</a></strong>, has no macOS application. I can forgive that but it doesn&rsquo;t read Fujifilm RAF files at all, which would mean I&rsquo;d have to convert everything into DNG first. That&rsquo;s a non-starter. It&rsquo;s also an app that feels very similar to Affinity Photo. Since I have a licence for it anyway (as I do for every app the Pixelmator team have produced), it stays on my iPad for situations where Lightroom is too limited for a specific task.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was good to see what the market currently offers and what I found was <strong>a)</strong> solid choices for different sets of needs and <strong>b)</strong> the realisation that Lightroom still fits my requirements best by</p>

<ul>
<li>having good, responsive iOS applications,</li>
<li>an okay macOS offering,</li>
<li>solid synchronisation of data and editing progress,</li>
<li>decent if not perfect rendering of Fujifilm RAF files,</li>
<li>and 1 TB of storage space, which works out as a very usable puzzle piece in my photo backup strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I had one wish for the Lightroom apps, it would be for Adobe to bring back geotagging. I miss this dearly from the classic Lightroom app.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My saddle was too low because the method I used to determine saddle height didn&rsquo;t work for me.</li>
<li>I tried to overcompensate for what I perceived as excessive reach by moving the saddle forward. Moving it back instead and improving my posture worked a treat.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>In mid-December 2020 another half-hearted lockdown loomed in my region and there was a possibility that exercise outside might actually be prohibited. That made the decision to finally pull the trigger on a smart bike trainer easy and I was lucky enough to snag a mid-range model before they went out of stock in Germany.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the smart trainer a lot and it&rsquo;s helped me improve my many aspects of my cardiovascular fitness. Something I&rsquo;ll write about at some point.<br />
The other benefit the bike trainer brought with it, was the ability to slowly but steadily improve my bike fit on both my road bike and my gravel bike. It&rsquo;s honestly had as much of, if not more of an impact on my riding as the marked improvement in fitness.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good resources for picking the right size of frame and dialling in the right position of the touch points on a bike, to achieve an optimal riding position. The three that have helped me the most since December are,</p>

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZ241fyVfiv3eAJ4UYkzeb2JltpLSlzs">Bike Fit Tuesdays</a>&rdquo; on Francis Cade&rsquo;s youtube channel,</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL1_j_gcxtpxJ-b9ptUikhStxEvkm1V7E">Bike Fitting Series (with Neill Stanbury)</a>&rdquo; on Cam Nicholls&rsquo;s youtube channel,</li>
<li>And the article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.mantel.com/blog/en/how-to-determine-the-correct-saddle-height">How to Determine the Correct Saddle Height</a>&rdquo; on the site of the cycling retailer Mantel, oddly enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>The big issue with attempting to try all of the advice thrown around is that it&rsquo;s hard to do on the bike when out riding or not being able to pedal while sitting on the bike. That&rsquo;s where the trainer came in really handy and I&rsquo;d encourage anyone to either buy or rent one, if you want to improve comfort and efficiency on your bicycle<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong><br />
Getting a professional bike fit has been something I considered to be something useful only for racers but I&rsquo;ve come to change my mind and would now recommend getting one to anybody who either plans on buying a new bicycle or has issues with comfort on their current one.</p>

<h2 id="so-here-s-what-i-learned">So here&rsquo;s what I learned</h2>

<p>The resources I linked to above have loads of great information and greatly improved my understanding of how certain changes to a bike influence my riding position. The findings listed here came as a bit of a surprise to me, or were generally counterintuitive based on the information that is out there.</p>

<h3 id="moving-my-saddle-back">Moving my saddle back</h3>

<p>James of Bicycle Richmond often mentions in the Bike Fit Tuesdays videos that many people buy bikes with excessive reach and then try to compensate for that by moving the saddle forward or hunching over the handlebars, which leads to all sorts of pains, mostly a lot of pressure on the hands and wrists.</p>

<p>Well for me it was a bit of a mixed bag. The bicycle frames I have are the right size, from what I can tell. I&rsquo;ve already equipped my road bike and gravel bike with comparatively shorts stems (~ 7 cm) and the handlebars I use also have short reach figures. Still, I felt the need to use seat posts with no setback and moved the saddles forward, often as far as they went. I did so because of things I read about a good angle between torso and upper arms and a general impression of being too stretched out on my steeds.</p>

<p>The result has always been the aforementioned impression of riding on a stretcher even while I felt hunched over the handlebars and putting a lot of weight onto my hands and wrists. This in turn caused numbness in my hands, sometimes after only 20–30 min of riding. On the bike trainer, when I wasn&rsquo;t shifting my position as often as I did riding outside, this effect was even more pronounced.</p>

<p>In one of the bike fitting videos I learned about hip position over the bottom bracket and how being too far forward could result in pains and less power output. I gave it a try, gradually moving the saddle back<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> and carefully tilting it forward a bit. This resulted in me rotating my upper body downward and my hip forward.<br />
I was honestly stunned by how suddenly my core muscles had an easier time supporting my upper body, less weight resting on the hands, and the bike feeling less long even though I technically increased the distance between the nose of my saddle and the handlebars.</p>

<p>Something was still a little off:</p>

<h3 id="my-saddle-was-too-low">My saddle was too low</h3>

<p>This realisation was the single biggest revelation to my riding comfort and equally importantly; my cycling efficiency.</p>

<p>One of the most commonly used methods to estimate/determine saddle height is the &ldquo;heel method&rdquo;, where you sit squarely on the saddle and place your heel on the pedal, with the leg fully extended. If you cannot extend the leg fully, move the saddle up. If you find that you&rsquo;re rolling of the side of the saddle trying to extend the leg, move the saddle down until you sit securely on the saddle again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been setting my saddle height using this method for years and it <em>Turns Out™</em> that it doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>

<p>Looking at a video my partner recorded, I noticed that in the lowest pedal position the underside of my foot was pretty much level with the ground and that the angle of my upper leg to my lower leg was larger than typically recommended.</p>

<p>After some reading, I discovered two methods for calculating saddle height (see the article linked above) and they gave me totally different numbers than the heel method and a new starting point for experimentation.</p>

<p>I gradually increased the height of my saddle and ended up with 3 cm more<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Honestly, that&rsquo;s a lot. The effects of this modification were and are profound:</p>

<li>I still feel perfectly planted on the saddle, perfectly secure sitting on the bike.</li>
<li>In the lowest pedal position my heel now sits higher than my toes and my leg is extended further. This has led directly to my calf muscles being activated and me being able to put more power down.</li>
<li>It made rotating my hip forward and my whole upper body downward even easier and even more comfortable.</li>

<h3 id="bonus-use-a-narrower-saddle-on-a-trainer">Bonus: use a narrower saddle on a trainer</h3>

<p>This one was a small but nice surprise.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my time with the smart trainer, I had specifically put a slightly wider saddle on my road bike thinking that the increased surface area would help spread the load I put on it, riding in a more static position than while out and about. After having already gone through the two steps above, I still felt some discomfort after a long time in the saddle on the trainer.</p>

<p>Looking for information, I stumbled across a video on the youtube cycling channel GCN where someone asked for advice with saddle sores/butt pain on a bike trainer. Their guidance was to use a narrower saddle than what one would typically use but obviously something that still supports the sit bones fully, to encourage more movement and better circulation while on a static trainer.</p>

<p>This bit of advice turned out to be bang-on for me and brought the desired improvement.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>Using a bike trainer allowed me to cautiously experiment and eventually massively improve my bike fit. I was lucky in the sense that my bicycles have the right size and my basic assumptions about reach and stem length were correct. Honestly, I should&rsquo;ve gotten a trainer (or better: a proper bike fit) a long time ago.</p>

<p>Cycling on my bikes now, I&rsquo;m much more relaxed, able to put much more power down at the same perceived exertion, and long rides are more enjoyable because my bikes feel more comfortable.<br />
On the gravel bike in tricky terrain there has been another positive side effect: due to the fact that I&rsquo;m putting less weight onto the handlebars and being in a generally more balanced forward/aft position on the bike, I&rsquo;m able to steer more nimbly. That gives me more confidence on technical climbs and descents and makes for a wildly improved and fun overall riding experience.</p>

<li id="fn:1">Another important part to this whole equation is being able to take videos of yourself on the bike trainer while pedalling (or having someone help you) while you wear tight-fitting clothing. It&rsquo;s going to make it easier to check and analyse your riding position.

			 <p>On a ride on Saturday I damaged the rear tyre on my gravel bike. Looks like I was riding with too little pressure for the terrain.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was only a puncture and tried to repair that. It sealed easily enough but with that fixed, it quickly became clear that the rim tape was damaged as well and air was leaking out of a spoke hole. Great, just great.</p>

<p>So, off with the tyre, off with the old rim tape. I cleaned everything nicely and put on new rim tape, put the tyre back on, and some fresh Stan&rsquo;s No Tubes Race Sealant in, pumped up the tyre and the second I hit 30 PSI, I had sealant spraying out of the side.</p>

<p>Turns Out™ that I did more damage to the tyre than I saw during the first two rounds of inspections. I created a 3 mm long slice in the tyre just above the hook of the rim (just to the right of the valve).</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-83x5bDz/0/dafc8a31/X4/i-83x5bDz-X4.jpg" alt="" title="Close-up of a black bicycle wheel with a tyre on. White tyre sealant is leaking from a puncture directly beneath the rim just to the right of the valve." /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky spot and not even the typically dependable Stan&rsquo;s sealant was able to close that one since there&rsquo;s always movement in this area. Luckily the tyre seems to still be usable.</p>

<p>So over the next few days, I&rsquo;ll have to clean all the sealant out, clean the inside of the mantle and reassemble everything with tubes. Not a big fan of it, because even running the very good Tubolito tubes will require me to ride with higher pressures compared to riding tubeless.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong></p>

<p>This episode once again showed me how the DT Swiss CR1600 rims are close to bomb-proof. I have two pairs and over the years I&rsquo;ve thrown serious abuse at them. Sure, they have a couple of scratches but both pairs still run absolutely true.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s really hard to put into words how painful it was to watch the events that unfolded in the U.S. Capitol yesterday. I&rsquo;m just a spectator from across the pond in Germany and still I&rsquo;m so worried. Worried for the friends I have over there, worried about this beautiful country, and worried about the state of the world as a whole witnessing these things.</p>

<p>The single most enraging, yet entirely unsurprising thing for me was the stark display of systemic racism, seeing how white thugs were able to stage a coup in the houses of the legislative branch incited by sitting, traitorous president and law enforcement didn&rsquo;t stop them. Had a group of Black and Brown people attempted something like this, U.S. law enforcement would have massacred them without hesitation, I have no doubt about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JpUxQyLCBbk">Stephen Colbert</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/UOIFBKB4mIE">Seth Meyers</a> did good monologues about the insurrection:</p>

</div>


<p>If this insurrection doesn&rsquo;t have palpable legal consequences for Donald Trump and all of his enablers, supporters, Fox News, and the insurgents who stormed and ransacked the Capitol buildings, this is going to happen again, and next time, they will be organised better, more violent, and more people will die before it&rsquo;s stopped, if it&rsquo;s stopped.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also acutely aware that the right wing forces in Germany will use this as a rallying cry and a blueprint for their next attempt to take control here and it makes my blood boil. There have already been messages from conservative German politicians making excuses, downplaying the events, and engaging in whataboutism. We&rsquo;re going to see the repercussions of this over here in a very short while and we&rsquo;ll have to be vigilant. I have no fucks left to give for any quarter offered to intolerant right wing fucks or believers of conspiracy myths.</p>

			 <p>A short chronology of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Mandalorian – Chapter 11: Bo-Katan Kryze<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tells the Din Djarin to seek out Ahsoka on a forest planet. <em>My jaw drops and I squeal with excitement. I rewind that scene, rewatch it, squeal again.</em></li>
<li>The Mandalorian – Chapter 13: <strong>We meet Ahsoka.</strong> Thrawn is mentioned, hinting at a larger quest to be explored by her. <em>I watch that episode five times.</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/i/events/1337183283059159040">Disney announces a metric ton of new projects</a>, among them an Ahsoka series. <em>I almost faint.</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Geteilte-Alben-und-content-delivery/n-XxcfNJ/Blog/i-RFqnm4f/0/9fea5b24/O/the_mandalorian-chapter_13-snapshot-ahsoka.png" alt="" title="Scene from chapter 13 of The Mandalorian. Ahsoka ambushes two henchmen of the magistrate, igniting her two white lightsabers right behind them." /></p>

<p>Ahsoka is by far (as in &ldquo;no other character comes close&rdquo;) my favourite character in the Star Wars universe. Her development, her character arc in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)">Clone Wars TV series</a> is second to none, especially if you watch <a href="https://disneyplus.com/series/star-wars-the-clone-wars/1wYXzjabXGVZ">the last season</a>, released on Disney+ earlier in 2020 <em>and</em> read the <a href="https://www.ekjohnston.ca/ahsoka">excellent book by E.K. Johnston called &ldquo;Star Wars: Ahsoka&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Geteilte-Alben-und-content-delivery/n-XxcfNJ/Blog/i-w33pXWj/0/b922b927/O/IMG_2628.jpg" alt="" title="Disney promo poster for the Ahsoka TV series. https://mobile.twitter.com/starwars/status/1337173861956108288" /></p>

<p>I still have a hard time containing my excitement and delight at seeing Ahsoka come to life (action) in this episode of The Mandalorian. Rosario Dawson, in my eyes, captured the character perfectly, down to the little mannerisms Ahsoka had in the latter seasons of The Clone Wars. I seriously cannot wait to see her reprise the role in a series centred around this force-wielding Togruta.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post a lot later than I had planned—life, amirite?—and I want to share two podcasts that only increased my enjoyment of the episode and pointed out a few things that I didn&rsquo;t notice during the first two or three times I watched the episode.<br />
Firstly, the <a href="https://twitter.com/DesiGeekGirls/status/1333111047343976459">recap of the episode on the Desi Geek Girls podcast</a> with the excellent Swapna Krishna and Preeti Chhibber. Secondly, Dan Moren&rsquo;s and guest Kelly Guimont&rsquo;s discussion of the episode on the <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/679/">teevee podcast &ldquo;A Complicated Profession&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing about this is going to be the wait. Ah well.</p>

			 <p>So, liebe asoziale Querfuzzis, Pandiemieanzweifler, Verschwörungsmystiker, rechte Abschaumler, Neoliberale, FDP-Parteimitglieder, Faschistenkuschler in allen Parteien, reichen euch 600 Tote pro Tag und knapp 30.000 COVID-19-Neuinfektionen? Oder wollt ihr mehr?</p>

<p>Als ich die Meldung heute früh in der Tagesschau-App sah, war ich einfach nur fassungslos.</p>

<p>Klar, von den oben genannten Personenkreisen habe ich derartiges Verhalten erwartet aber ich hatte trotzdem eine kleine, verschwindend geringe Hoffnung, dass dieser &ldquo;Lockdown Light&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> und die damit verbundenen Bedingungen und Ankündigungen von Konsequenzen bei Zuwiderhandlung irgendetwas bringen würden. Letztendlich hat sich wieder gezeigt, dass die Experten Recht hatten und es einen Scheiss gebracht hat.</p>

<p>Die Landesregierungen haben, aus meiner Sicht, auf ganzer Linie versagt. Dieses permanente Hin-und-Her und die Weigerung den Empfehlungen der Bundesregierung zu folgen sind einfach nur peinlich. Dann noch dieses nervige, kontraproduktive Penisgewedel der Landesfürsten, um Kanzlerin Merkel auflaufen zu lassen und den Lobbyisten ja keinen Grund zu geben, die Angebote für zukünftige Aufsichtsratsposten in Frage zu stellen.</p>

<p>Es reicht mir. Setzt endlich mal einen Lockdown an. Wir in Deutschland, und die westlichen Staaten insgesamt, müssen endlich von ihrem hohen, durchseuchten Roß runter kommen und sich anschauen, wie andere Länder es gemacht haben. Schaut mal auf Asien und Australien.</p>

<p>Dann noch bitte Mittel zum Schutz der Allgemeinheit unbürokratisch zur Verfügung stellen und Verstöße gegen die Pandemieeindämmungsverordnungen mit sensiblen, an das Einkommen der Person oder Organisation geknüpfte Strafen ahnden und wir könnten es nach sechs Wochen vielleicht schaffen da raus zu kommen.</p>

<p>Ich hatte bisher Glück und bin weder selbst infiziert, noch jemand in meiner näheren Umgebung, und es gab im Familien-, Freundes- und Bekanntenkreis erst sehr wenige Tote. Aber selbst die waren zu viel. Ich habe keine Lust, dass den Personen, die ich liebe etwas zustößt, weil irgendwelche Asozialen sich weigern die Gemeinschaft zu unterstützen.</p>

<p>Ich werde fortan Solidaritätsverweigerern gegenüber keinerlei Toleranz zeigen. Ich habe schlichtweg genug.</p>

			 <p>On Saturday, I managed to beat my <em>innerer Schweinehund</em> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to go out for a winter cold/bad weather ride. I had wanted to take Swift Wind on a route I&rsquo;ve ridden a number of times since moving to Freiburg, to finally see how it compared to my gravel bike with road tyres.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-GcjrdBJ/0/1d02da79/O/i-GcjrdBJ.jpg" alt="" title="Strava map of ride on 2020.12.05" /></p>

<p>It was a good ride for the most part and once again I felt the differences between a true road bike and a road rubber-equipped gravel bike when it comes to, well, riding on the road. The weather was grey, moody, a bit of rain came down, too, and the roads were wet and dirty. Back home Swift Wind looked as dirty as Battle Cat, if you replaced the dirt and mud the latter attracts cycling off road with grime from the street.</p>

<p>This was also the first wet weather outing with the Mavic Kysrium Pro Exalith wheels and I came away impressed with the stopping power and modulation of the wheel set/brake pad combination. Yes, they still scream like a banshee when breaking but that&rsquo;s going to go away.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-rDG5Fh7/0/a65b8b41/X5/i-rDG5Fh7-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Titanium road bike, dirty from the grime off wet roads and bike paths, stood up against a sign post. A dirt path next to the river Dreisam and the hills in the distance forming the backdrop." /></p>

<p>The more important take-away from the ride was the realisation that somehow my bikes still don&rsquo;t fit me perfectly. On all three of my bikes, road, gravel, CX-turned-commuter I start to get numb hands after a certain amount of time and on the two drop bar bikes my feet start to tingle on longer excursions, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting a proper bike fit for a while, even if it means that the bike fitters are going to tell me that my bikes are the wrong size. Still, it irks me because the road bike and the gravel bike were bought based on the fact they have a similar if not identical geometry to my correctly sized CX bike<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t feel stretched out on my bikes, I always feel in full control of the steed no matter the terrain, and generally, I&rsquo;m comfortable. Ah well.</p>

<p>I called one of the bike shops in the area that offers bike fittings to ask a few questions and to set up an appointment. The person I spoke to told me that what I was likely going to need is a professional bike fit by one of their partners (which I had expected) but before I went that route, they asked which issues I had. After a brief description they advised me to try something else before a bike fit: a wider saddle.</p>

<p>They said that many people use too narrow a saddle or one that isn&rsquo;t wide enough to support their sit bones properly in the preferred position they ride a particular bike in. Because of that, the nerves leading towards the feet are compressed on the one hand and on the other hand, in an effort to compensate the pressure on the butt, some people will put too much weight on the upper body and hands.</p>

<p>That… sounded eerily close to how I felt I was behaving on my bicycles.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I use two saddle models: A Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow in the 148 mm width with the carbon shell and rails, and a Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston in the 143 mm width. My sit bones are 123 mm apart, so 140+ mm should be the proper width, based on the manufacturers&rsquo; and retailers&rsquo; recommendations, and in the case of the Fabric, after trying the saddle in the shop for a good amount of time.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I get sore hands and numb feet more slowly on the Specialized saddle. With the input I received from the bike fitter in the bike shop, I think this may be because the Elaston cushioning manages to compensate for a potentially too narrow saddle for a certain amount of time while cycling.<br />
This also fits with what I&rsquo;ve read doing additional research about the Power Arc saddles on the internet. Seemingly, due to the strong curvature of the saddle, width numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story and more than one person found a better fit sizing up.</p>

<p>A 155 mm Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston is on its way to me and should arrive later this week. I&rsquo;m very curious to find out if this changes things for me. It would be nice to get the fit dialled without a bike fit and at this point I&rsquo;m not ruling out anything, neither too narrow a saddle, nor a completely wrong understanding of bike sizing, or even the fact that I have too many pounds on my ribs for the type of bike I&rsquo;m trying to ride.</p>

<li id="fn:1">That&rsquo;s a German figure of speech that there&rsquo;s no elegant English translation for. Literally it means &ldquo;one&rsquo;s inner swine dog&rdquo; and the closest meaningful translation is &ldquo;one&rsquo;s weaker self&rdquo;. Beating your &ldquo;innerer Schweinehund&rdquo; means &ldquo;to overcome one&rsquo;s weaker self&rdquo; but really, it lacks some of the pathos we Germans imbue this phrase with.

<li id="fn:2">I had the CX bike fitted at the manufacturer (Canyon in Koblenz, Germany). They took detailed measurements of me and found that I fell between two sizes. I got to try a number of sizes of the same model and the smaller of the two recommended ones was too short, felt too twitchy. The larger of the two felt perfectly right under my butt. I even tried the next size up to be sure and that one was way too stretched out and unwieldy.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:2"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:3">I&rsquo;ve done my best to make sure the reach of my bikes is correct, the saddle is not too high, my cleats are set up the way they need to be, the saddle tilt is right, and the drop bars and levers are set up properly. I&rsquo;ve watched numerous videos on the topic, read up about it, etc. I tried everything short of getting a professional bike fit.

			 <p>There&rsquo;s an interesting article up on Gravel Cyclist:<br />
&ldquo;<a href="https://gravelcyclist.com/bicycle-tech/has-gravel-riding-got-you-over-tired-over-tyred-by-big-head-todd/">Has Gravel Riding Got You Over-Tired / Over-Tyred? – By Big Head Todd</a>&ldquo;</p>

<p>In the article the author, Big Head Todd, vents a bit about the trend towards ever more aggressive tyres on gravel bikes these days, whether that be people adding them because they think they need them or because bicycle manufacturers add them as spec.</p>

<p>Reading through it, I nodded my head a lot because, inexperienced as I was/am with tyre choice, I&rsquo;ve fallen into the same trap not too long ago and it took many rides on all kinds of terrain to take a step back and rethink how much tread I actually need.</p>

<p>My gravel bike sports a pair of WTB Nano 40 right now. These are absolute overkill for a lot of the gravel roads that I encounter. The Specialized Pathfinder Pro with 38 mm on my second wheel set (slick center channel and fairly tame knobs on the sides), are far more appropriate and offer much more versatility.
The reason the Nano 40 spend more time on my bike than the Pathfinders, is because in recent months, I&rsquo;ve been riding on terrain that would typically be considered MTB territory most of the time. And even if I leave out the occasional section of tame single track, I kind of enjoy going up challenging climbs with this bike; loose ground, roots, and sometimes muddy paths, where I struggle to find traction even with the WTB Nano 40 at low pressures and a gearing of 30 in the front and 40 in the back.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-W6NsDnV/0/02f5076e/X5/i-W6NsDnV-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Titanium gravel bike with muddy tyres leaning against a wooden pole, in front of a slightly blurred forest scenery" /></p>

<p>The Specialized Pathfinder Pro are an utterly delightful bit of rubber. Very much comparable to the excellent Donnelly X&rsquo;Plor MSO 40 mm but more durable. They take a bit of getting used to, in that finding the right tyre pressure for the right terrain and rider/system weight isn&rsquo;t as simple as with other tyres. Once I had a rough idea about that, it was simple to do the first half of a ride on gravel with stupid low pressures, letting the Pathfinder Pro climb really well and spend the second part of the ride blasting down a hill on tarmac, the tyres inflated to a higher pressure.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Snapshots/2020-10/i-mt8wJ8Q/0/c2928437/X5/C1A5D4F5-C2A3-4FDE-AAE0-C5973670F516_1_201_a-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Close-up photograph of the back wheel of a gravel bike to showcase the semi-slick Specialized Pathfinder Pro gravel tyre" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I have the WTB Nano 40 but at the same time, it would have been nice to know and understand the true capabilities of seemingly tame gravel tyres.<br />
So if you&rsquo;re looking for a good set of rubber for your do-it-all bike, think hard on where you ride and do some research before defaulting to the monster truck option.</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across this <a href="https://twitter.com/Idle_Threat/status/1315244312922333184">on Twitter</a>. Originally this seems to be from the platform Quora but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find the original posting.</p>

<p>The question asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do people get angry when I try to share the word of God with them? I only do it because I care about them deeply and don&rsquo;t want them to end up in hell. I feel like some people avoid me because of this. Is there any way to get through to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A person calling themselves &ldquo;Doug Robertson&rdquo; responded with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire process is not what you think it is.
It is specifically designed to be uncomfortable for the other person because it isn&rsquo;t about converting them to your religion. It is about manipulating you so you can&rsquo;t leave yours.<br />
If this tactic was about converting people it would be considered a horrible failure. It recruits almost no one who isn&rsquo;t already willing to join. Bake sales are more effective recruiting tools. On the other hand, it is extremely effective at creating a deep tribal feeling among its own members.</p>

<p>The rejection they receive is actually more important than the few people they convert. It causes them to feel a level of discomfort around the people they attempt to talk to. These become the &ldquo;others&rdquo;. These uncomfortable feelings go away when they come back to their congregation, the &ldquo;Tribe&rdquo;.
If you take a good look at the process it becomes fairly clear. In most cases, the religious person starts out from their own group, who is encouraging and supportive. They are then sent out into the harsh world where people repeatedly reject them. Mainly because they are trained to be so annoying.<br />
These brave witnesses then return from the cruel world to their congregation where they are treated like returning heroes. They are now safe. They bond as they share their experiences of reaching out to the godless people to bring them the truth. They share the otherness they experience.<br />
Once again they will learn that the only place they are accepted is with the people who think as they do. It isn&rsquo;t safe to leave the group. The world is your enemy, but we love you.</p>

<p>This is a pain reward cycle that is a common brainwashing technique. The participants become more and more reliant on the &ldquo;Tribe&rdquo; because they know that &ldquo;others&rdquo; reject them.<br />
Mix in some ritualized chanting, possibly a bit of monotonous repetition of instructions, add a dash of fear of judgment by an unseen, but all-powerful entity who loves you if you do as you are told and you get a pretty powerful mix. Sorry, I have absolutely no wish to participate in someones brainwashing ritual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This answer resonated with me not just in the way it mirrored experiences I had with certain types of people considering themselves religious. Also with the increasing number of people who believe in conspiracy myths, particularly those fuelled by or based in anti-semitic and fascist movements.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So that was an interesting ride on Saturday. Due to poor time management and lots of rain, I didn&rsquo;t manage to go for a ride during the week. On Saturday there was heavy rain in the morning but the skies opened up towards the afternoon and Battle Cat and I were itching to go for a ride on wet forest roads. 😄</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-FqzdTx2/0/25a1a688/X5/i-FqzdTx2-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Forest path falling off to the right, sunlight streaming through the trees." /></p>

<p>The ride started on familiar steep trails and forest roads, not surprising but still taxing.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-N292V9h/0/83b01e63/X5/i-N292V9h-X5.jpg" alt="" title="View into the Steurental, a grassy valley with transmission towers threaded down the valley." /></p>

<p>After the first two hundred meters of climbing on sometimes tricky terrain—the WTB Nano 40 tyres had their work cut out of them—I stopped on a meadow for a couple of bites of energy bar and to take some obligatory photos of my bike mid-ride. Obligatory.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-4Mt9Qw4/0/8c995245/X5/i-4Mt9Qw4-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Muddy titanium gravel bike from the side and behind in front a forest and hills, the recently added Black Lives Matter sticker gleaming in the sun." /></p>

<p>I rode past a bunch of young, curious cows who followed me to the place where I had stopped. Two of them were quite insistent to get face scritches and I obliged.<br />
What I didn&rsquo;t expect, though, was that I had to go over their pasture to continue on my planned route and I expected even less that they&rsquo;d attempt to join me.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nn8FCNZ/0/f4b93f61/X5/i-Nn8FCNZ-X5.jpg" alt="" title="A herd of young cows walking towards the photographer on a pasture on the side of a hill in bright sunlight." /></p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wws2m8J/0/0b5a2ec4/X5/i-wws2m8J-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Herd of cows following the cyclist in one line on a pasture service road." /></p>

<p>After that things went downhill quickly by going uphill too steeply.<br />
Turns Out™ I had planned this next part of the route badly.  For some reason the gradient data Komoot (and Open Street Maps) has for that part of the forest road, is so terribly off that a section where I expected to ride up a ~ 15% gradient—steep but not impossible—was actually a rarely used forestry operation road carved up by heavy machinery and rain with a 25%+ gradient.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pHHFfMt/0/d750fda3/X2/i-pHHFfMt-X2.jpg" alt="" title="Strava map of ride on 2020_10_03" /></p>

<p>Not fun. I pushed or carried my bike uphill for over a kilometre. At the top, which was also the highest point of yesterday&rsquo;s tour, I was exhausted and panting like a furry dog in the midst of summer. Not good.</p>

<p>The following 10 km compensated me for that slog with beautiful view and incredible riding over everything from flowy double track, challenging single track, even more challenging—for a gravel bike—uphill single track over rocks and roots and finally a long and fast descent towards the Schlossberg on fire roads.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nc3kV2r/0/80978ea4/X5/i-Nc3kV2r-X5.jpg" alt="" title="View from the Kandelhöhenweg over Freiburg-Zähringen and Freiburg-Herdern." /></p>

<p>It was my first time at the viewpoint next to the tram on the Schlossberg and I enjoyed seeing the city I now live in from yet another perspective.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-zQdHnbk/0/d2ecf86a/X5/i-zQdHnbk-X5.jpg" alt="" title="View over downtown Freiburg from the tram on the Schlossberg." /></p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-9bLBwsD/0/0f81520d/X5/i-9bLBwsD-X5.jpg" alt="" title="Titanium gravel bike leaning against a fence overlooking downtown Freiburg and the Freiburger Münster." /></p>

<p>Standing there, eating the rest of my energy bar, I had to concede that the climbs at the start of the tour combined with the gruelling ascent pushing the bike robbed me of so much energy, that finishing the ride on the planned route (back through the forest) wasn&rsquo;t possible and so I rode home on the road … a bit annoyed because chunky gravel tyres make riding on tarmac feel like wading through molasses but I was still happy overall.</p>

			 <p>Ich habe gerade Urlaub und versucht meinen Social Media-Konsum auf ein Minimum herunterzufahren. Leider hat das aufgrund der Demo in Berlin nicht geklappt.</p>

<p>Wie erwartet war diese Demo ein Desaster auf ganzer Linie, ein wiederholtes Beispiel des völligen Versagens des Innenministeriums auf Bundes- und auf Berliner Landesebene, und für mich der aktuellste Hinweis auf einen Staatsapparat, der zunehmend von Rechtsradikalen und Rechtsextremen unterwandert wurde.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-demo-berlin-131.html">Die Bilder von Reichsflaggen vor dem Deutschen Bundestag und die versuchte Erstürmung des Bundestagsgebäudes durch Rechte</a> und andere verabscheuungswürdige, demokratiefeindliche Personen haben mich nachhaltig entsetzt.<br />
Diese Aktion war angekündigt. Es war klar, dass es versucht werden würde. Nur durch den beherzten Einsatz dreier Polizisten unter Lebensgefahr wurde die vollständige Erreichung der Ziele der Rechtsextremen vereitelt.</p>

<p>Aus dem oben verlinkten Tagesschau-Artikel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SPD-Kanzlerkandidat Olaf Scholz schrieb: &ldquo;Unser Grundgesetz garantiert Meinungsfreiheit und das Demonstrationsrecht. Es ist die Antwort auf das Scheitern der Weimarer Republik und den Schrecken der NS-Zeit. Nazisymbole, Reichsbürger- &amp; Kaiserreichflaggen haben vor dem Deutschen Bundestag rein gar nichts verloren.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schöne Worte. Wäre super, wenn da Konsequenzen folgen. Herr Scholz, wieso überdenken Sie nicht mal ihre Aussagen zu den gewaltsamen Niederschlagungen linker Demos in Hamburg vor ein paar Jahren? Ach und CumEx steht auch noch im Raum. Nur mal so am Rande.</p>

<p>Unser Innenminister Horst Seehofer hat – ausgerechnet in der Bild am Sonntag – folgendes gesagt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Meinungsvielfalt ist ein Markenzeichen einer gesunden Gesellschaft. Die Versammlungsfreiheit hat aber dort ihre Grenzen, wo staatliche Regeln mit Füßen getreten werden&rdquo; […] &ldquo;Das Reichstagsgebäude ist die Wirkungsstätte unseres Parlaments und damit das symbolische Zentrum unserer freiheitlichen Demokratie. Dass Chaoten und Extremisten es für ihre Zwecke missbrauchen, ist unerträglich. Ich danke der Polizei, dass sie uns heute schnell und konsequent davor bewahrt hat. Der Staat muss gegenüber solchen Leuten mit null Toleranz und konsequenter Härte durchgreifen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wieso wundert es mich nicht, dass Seehofer nicht „rechte Chaoten und Rechtsextremisten“ gesagt hat?</p>

<p>Wir brauchen keine leeren Worte, sondern konkrete Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung von Rechtsextremismus und Rechtsterrorismus. Diese Politiker könnten etwas bewirken, sie haben die Autorität und die Mittel etwas zu tun.</p>

<p>Ich bin mittlerweile einfach nur noch sauer und meine Geduld, speziell für unaufrichtige und gefährliche Relativierungen von Links und Rechts, ist auf einem Tiefpunkt.</p>

<p>Oder anders ausgedrückt: <strong>Personen in Positionen der Macht</strong>, in Positionen mit politischem Einfluss, mit einem Mandat zum Schutz unserer demokratischen Grundordnung, <strong>die sich nicht zum Antifaschismus bekennen</strong>, die ihren Einfluss und ihre Fähigkeiten nicht in den Schutz unserer Demokratie investieren, <strong>sehe ich fortan als rechten Sympathisant:innen, rechte Kollaborateur:innen, oder einfach Rechtsextreme</strong>. Und diese Personen müssen mit allen legitimen Mittel in unserem Rechtsstaat bekämpft werden.</p>

<p>Oder nochmal anders ausgedrückt: <strong><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleranz-Paradoxon">Keine Toleranz für Intoleranz!</a></strong></p>

			 <p>This video popped up in the <a href="https://theradavist.com/2020/08/9-miles/">Radavist</a> feed a few days ago and it really spoke to me.</p>

<p>It was made by the bicycle manufacturer Bombtrack and showcases one person’s local loop, the go-to bike route the person takes when they just want to hop on the bike and ride for a bit to free their head.</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>


<p>I had my own local loop back in Trier, a 22 km route that I knew I could do in just over an hour, that gave me a variety of terrain, a technical climb, a gruelling climb, some very tight and root-y paths, and two fast descents.</p>

<p>Having only moved to the Black Forest (close to Freiburg im Breisgau) a couple of months ago, I don’t yet have that same loop down but I may be close. I found a nice little piece of singletrack last week that perfectly stitches together a flat gravel section with a forest path climb.</p>

<p>I may have to ride this today. 🚲</p>

			 <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Slept in. Really.</li>
<li>Had an extended, Hobbit-worthy breakfast outside watching Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which was frequently interrupted by raucous sparrows and blackbirds in our garden.</li>
<li>Switched the PressFit bottom bracket in my commuter bike. Another bike maintenance first for me and it went better than expected.</li>
<li>Cooked a very tasty dish that was enjoyed on the terrace along with a cold beer.</li>
<li>Combined the weekend grocery shopping with a bicycle ride and I was properly exhausted back home, lugging a heavily laden bike trailer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Slept in even longer than on Saturday.</li>
<li>Made a proper English breakfast for my partner and I.</li>
<li>Booked a hut in the alps for our upcoming vacation.</li>
<li>Went hiking on the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.schwarzwald-tourismus.info/touren/geniesserpfad-menzenschwander-geissenpfad-e2ed2f065b">Menzenschwander Geißenpfad</a>&rdquo;. A positively mellow 10.something hike inside a valley.</li>
<li>Ended the weekend watching DS9 in the sitting room with my partner, our two exhausted dogs snoring gently on the couch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Relaxing weekend.</p>

			 <p>What a fun morning ride.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Snapshots/2020-08/i-cLTCkMx/0/0f2eb498/X2/IMG_5297-X2.jpg" alt="Strava map of ride on 2020_08_18" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to take the road up to St. Märgen for a while now but was hesitant because it&rsquo;s quite a long climb. Having tackled the road to the top of the Schauinsland last week, I was sure I&rsquo;d be able to do this without too much pain.<br />
It turns out that the climb is quite mellow and manageable, which was a welcome surprise. I was properly exhausted at the top, of course, because 16 km at an average gradient of 5% is not nothing but the views from St. Märgen and the area surrounding it, as well as the descent back down into the valley more than made up for it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/08/11/my-new-bike.html">Road bike rebuild project: Litespeed Tuscany (2004)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/08/11/my-new-bike.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-08-11 14:11:00 &#43;0100">Aug 11, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well, I succumbed.</p>

<p>After so many road rides on my <a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/05/13/first-impressions-ethirteen.html">commuter/road bike with its 1×12 gearing</a>, I realised that having a proper drop bar road bike would be nice because switching the wheel set on Battle Cat, my gravel bike, becomes annoying quickly with my riding being 60/40 gravel/road, and I really don’t want to put aero bars on my gravel bike.</p>

<p>When I saw a good offer for a used Litespeed road bike, I pounced. It’s a 2004—I think—Litespeed Tuscany and it had a mix of Campagnolo Record/Chorus 2×10 components, Zonda G3 &amp; G4 wheels, a 46/36 carbon FSA crankset, and a 13–26 cassette.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pxvLz2S/0/c8260ddf/4K/i-pxvLz2S-4K.jpg" alt="Litespeed Tuscany with Campagnolo components and FSA finishing kit" /></p>

<p>Hopping on the bike for the first time was a strange feeling. Not only had I never ridden a Campagnolo group<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> before, the geometry was completely off. And I mean … <em>what?</em><br />
The previous owner of the bike supposedly is 2 cm shorter than I am and has a 1 cm shorter inseam length. It felt like I was lying on the bike and not sitting on it. My only guess is that the previous owner must have a long torso and long arms. I wasn’t able to do anything about the crazy long reach of the drop bars or the 110 mm stem or the 35 mm setback of the seat post but all of this was going to change anyway.</p>

<p>I was going to completely dismantle the bike and upgrade the components, mostly with things I still had in my workshop and some which I bought used off classifieds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full mechanical Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset with a 11-speed 11–32 cassette.</li>
<li>The Easton EA90 crankset with a 46/30 chainring, that I ran on my gravel bike, because I like my legs and the hills here are steep.</li>
<li>An Easton EA70 seat post and stem. The seat post has no setback and the stem is 70 mm long.</li>
<li>A Canyon H17 drop bar replaces the very strangely shaped FSA drop bars.</li>
<li>The Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow saddle that served me on my commuter until then.</li>
<li>Specialized HD Wrap bar tape.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>I searched for a new wheel set, too, but anything that could have be seen as an improvement over the Campagnolo wheels that were already on the bike would’ve made this project unnecessarily expensive. To my utter delight I found that Campagnolo used to make (and maybe still makes) 11-speed Shimano HG free hubs for these old wheel sets and the switch was just as easy as with the DT Swiss wheels that I’ve come to get used to over the past few years. Considering that this wheel set is 14+ years old, I was rather impressed, and really; it looks hella cool.<br />
The tyres are Continental Four Seasons in 25 mm and barely show signs of wear, so they’re sticking around, too.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This past weekend, after I had all components and tools I needed, including a Shimano ISIS bottom bracket removal tool that was kindly lent to me by the owner of a local bike shop, and I began the process of disassembling bike, cleaning everything thoroughly, checking for as of then unseen defects, and putting it back together with new parts.</p>

<p>The process involved a few neat little bike maintenance firsts for me: shortening a carbon steerer tube, installing a BSA bottom bracket, and setting up modern symmetric dual pivot road bike rim brakes — <em>and there I was thinking properly aligning disc brake pads was fiddly.</em>
I’ve learned quite a bit and I’m happy about it.</p>

<p>The end result looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-BmnMwL5/0/9d2e47c8/4K/i-BmnMwL5-4K.jpg" alt="Litespeed Tuscany with Shimano &amp; Easton components, Easton finishing kit, and Campagnolo wheels" /></p>

<p>I’m still getting used to the horizontal top tube—it kind of betrays the age of the frame—but the first proper ride this morning was gobs of fun. I picked a short but taxing route up a familiar hill with a manageable gradient to see how it climbs and down a proper descent to see how fast it would go.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>During the assembly process, I kept wondering what to call this new bike and it came to me while blasting down the road from St. Peter towards Eschbach: sticking with the „Masters of the Universe“ theme the bike will carry the name „<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Wind">Swift Wind</a>“.</p>

<p>The aero bars are coming on over the next few days and I need different pedals for it but I am very much looking forward to all of the riding I’ll be doing with it.</p>

<li id="fn:1">Side note: For a ~ 14 years old group set, shifting is very crisp, akin to the SRAM X01 Eagle group I have on my commuter bike. Each downshift is accompanied by a solid <strong>thunk</strong> with a very positive lever action. I can understand why these components are still as expensive as they are.

		<div class="e-content">
			 

<p><code>Warning, this may be a bit wordy and nerdy.</code></p>

<p>I have been researching drivetrain options again—don‘t judge me—because I found myself wanting a bit more evenly and tightly spaced gears on both my road bike and my gravel bike.<br />
The area I moved to a while back (southern Black Forest, Germany) is an absolute dream for cyclists: I can climb to my heart‘s content either on- or off- road and when I just want to go fast on the flat, a short trip into the <em>wiiide</em> Rhine valley and it‘s <strong>go-time</strong> – yes, I went there.</p>

<h2 id="current-setup">Current setup</h2>

<p>On Panthor, my road bike, I presently have a 1× (single chainring) setup using a 36-tooth chainring and a 12-speed 9–46 e*thirteen TRS+ 2nd gen cassette. For the 11 gear shifts, I get an average gear ratio change of 13.8%. The gear ratio in the lowest gear is 0.78 and in the highest gear it‘s 4.0.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>On Battle Cat, my gravel bike, it’s a 1× setup with a 32-tooth chainring on the front and a 11-speed 9–39 e*thirteen XCX cassette on the back. That gives me a solid 0.82 gear ratio on the bottom end of the spectrum and 3.55 on the top end, as well as 10 gear changes with an average gear ratio change of 13.6%.</p>

<h2 id="changing-things-up">Changing things up</h2>

<p>Digging into some good combinations of cassette and chain rings, I had two sets of requirements
1. A closer grouping of the gears on the road bike is desirable but with at least one climbing gear with a gear ratio below 1.
2. A low climbing gear on the gravel bike is a must given the steep and quite technical terrain I‘m riding more and more often but I also want fairly evenly spaced gears throughout the range, to tackle longer rides across varied terrain more comfortably.</p>

<p>There‘s an incredible amount of choice in the market for realising what I wanted on both bikes but in all cases I found out that a 2× (double chainring) setup was probably the only way to get there.</p>

<p>Most cyclists know or have heard that a 2×11 setup typically offers 14 unique gears. This can vary depending on the choice of  chainrings and cassette in the back. I‘ve compared a lot of cassettes and chainring combinations using a nifty little online gear calculation tool by <a href="https://www.j-berkemeier.de/Ritzelrechner.html">Jürgen Berkemeier</a>; everything from the e*thirteen and Shimano cassettes I have at home to options from SRAM, Sunrace, Garbaruk, KCNC, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, I looked at various double chainring options, ranging from insane 53/38 to the 46/36 I still have on my Rotor 3D30 crankset to 46/30. Most of those combinations when paired with almost any cassette end up giving me 14 unique gears, a few give me 15 and even fewer only 13.
Interestingly, depending on the difference in teeth between the big and small chainrings, I‘ve seen cassette + double-chainrings combinations where the shift from big to small or small to big chainring (and compensating in the rear) results in a 2%–4% gear ratio increase. I‘d consider this barely usable, which means that these combinations really only offer 14 instead of 15 or 13 instead of 14 unique and usable gears.</p>

<h2 id="now-here-s-the-funny-bit">Now here‘s the funny bit.</h2>

<p>46/30 chainrings are the only ones I found that, paired with the right cassette in the back, end up with 15 proper, unique gears and a change from the small to the big front ring (again while compensating 3 gears on the cassette), results in an actually usable jump of 7%–9%.<br />
I checked other variations of 16-tooth difference chainrings but none seemed to work out with such a high gear ratio increase.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It gets even funnier looking at the cassettes. Only two cassettes I‘ve found, have cog size spacing that results in 15 proper gears:
* Shimano CS-R8000 11–32
* Shimano CS-M8000 11–40</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>

<p>I‘m going back to 2× on both my bikes. – <strong><em>GASP!</em></strong></p>

<p>Panthor is going to receive a 46/30 chainring coupled with the 11–32 cassette. This gets me a gear ratio of 0.9375 in the lowest and 4.18 in the highest gear and and average gear ratio change of 10.11%, a reduction of ~ 3.6%. This average value may not sound like too much but looking at the gear ratio changes across the current 11 and soon 14 shifts, it‘s substantially closer gearing that‘ll give me a much more consistent cadence.</p>

<p>Battle Cat will also get a 46/30 chainring connected to a 12–40 cassette.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The low gear will offer a ratio of 0.75—*WOOOOO! Insane climbs here I come!*—and the high gear is going to have a value of 3.83, which is plenty. The average gear ratio value will be ~ 11% (down from 13.6%) across 14 gear changes (up from 10).</p>

<p>I’m not sure how long this is going to stick, if I like the setups for riding, and to a lesser degree from a visual perspective – vanity in cycling is a thing, y‘know.<br />
Thankfully I still have a set of Ultegra R8000 brake shifters and an Ultegra R800 front derailleur at home. The remaining parts like the new chainrings for both bikes were fairly easily found. The Rotor 46/30 direct-mount chainrings are already here and the Easton Gravel Rings, the left GRX brake shifter and the second front derailleur should be here by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the tinkering and trying these two new setups.</p>

<li id="fn:1">Quick foot note: the reason the road bike has such a very unusual setup for now, is because it‘s also my shopping and commuter bike, that I sometimes pull my dog in a trailer in. Now not only my needs and wants are shifting, I‘ve also become a stronger cyclist over the past few months. It‘s time to experiment a bit.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:1"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:2">I honestly haven‘t had the inclination to dive into the math why the product of certain combinations of chainrings, all with 16-tooth jumps, didn’t result in the same usable amount of gears on the cassettes I looked at.

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/06/08/fixing-tubeless-valve.html">Fixing tubeless valve seal issues with DT Swiss CR 1600 Spline wheels</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/06/08/fixing-tubeless-valve.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-08 09:19:31 &#43;0100">Jun 8, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the process of setting up my second <a href="https://www.dtswiss.com/de/produkte/laufraeder-strasse/cross-road/cr-1600-spline#models">CR 1600 Spline</a> wheel set tubeless, I ran into the issue of the wheels not holding pressure again. The tubeless valves that DT Swiss provide with their wheels, or rather the gasket used, simply doesn’t seal well in those rims (the middle and right gaskets in the picture below).</p>

<p>For this wheel set I bought a set of <a href="https://muc-off.com/products/red-tubeless-presta-valve-pair">Muc-Off Tubeless Presta Valves</a>, which also came with three different types of gaskets. Being hopeful, I tried using the gasket that looked similar to the one supplied by DT Swiss and it was a failure, like last time. The tyres/wheels wouldn’t hold air well and my workshop smelled like Muc-Off sealant all day.</p>

<p>The solution was to switch to the biggest gasket supplied with the valves (pictured left). Even with the valve screw tightened down with less force, I got a proper seal immediately and the next morning the tyre pressure gauge showed the same 4.8 Bar I pumped the tyres up to.</p>

<p>Yesterday I took the bike out for a ride and everything worked perfectly with no pressure loss whatsoever.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-NwnjFc7/1/731d6fb7/O/i-NwnjFc7.jpg" alt="Red Muc-Off Tubeless Presta valve with two types of rubber gaskets in front of it" title="Muc-Off Tubeless Presta valve with two types of rubber gaskets" /></p>

<p>Side note:<br />
Apart from this issue with getting a good tubeless valve seal, the wheel set(s) have been incredible. Considering the amount of abuse I subject one of them to, it’s surprising that it still runs perfectly true. Really good value for money. Fitting most tyres (tubeless or tubed) is a breeze.</p>

<p>There is a criminal in the White House. A traitor to the American people, aided and abetted by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/kelly-loeffler-trump-super-pac-272626">corrupt</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-closing-insider-trading-investigations-loeffler-feinstein-inhofe/story?id=70890955">Attorney General</a>, encouraged and protected by a criminally depraved Republican Party who use Trump as a shield to pursue their worst impulses and to enrich themselves and their friends.</p>

<p>This man and his cronies are actively dismantling what remains of the democracy of the United States and they do not care how many U.S. citizens they kill to achieve the goal of turning the republic into an empire.</p>

<p>As the researcher and writer <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior/status/1086668294776602625">Sarah Kendzior said</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a transnational crime syndicate masquerading as a government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump and the rest of his regime must be voted out and prosecuted. There is nothing they fear more than losing the election in November because if they do, there&rsquo;s a faint chance they might face consequences for their actions, and they are doing everything in their power to prevent this from happening.</p>

			 <p>Das unser deutscher Verfassungsschutz zumindest inkompetent ist und häufig höchst bedenkliche Entscheidungen trifft, <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/chronologie-rechtsterrorismus-101.html">war schon bekannt, bevor die Ausmaße der Terrorserie des NSU ans Licht kamen</a>. So viel ist, denke ich, unumstritten.</p>

<p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Maaßen">Mit den Äußerungen des ehemaligen Chefs des BfV, Hans-Georg Maaßen, am 07.09.2019 zu den Hetzjagden gegen ausländisch aussehende Menschen durch Rechtsradikale in Chemnitz</a>, fragte ich mich zum ersten Mal wie weit – nicht ob – der Verfassungsschutz von Rechtsradikalen und Rechtsextremen unterwandert wurde.<br />
Die offensichtliche ideologische Nähe von Maaßen und der NSDAP-Nachfolgepartei AfD machen dies nicht besser. <a href="https://twitter.com/HGMaassen/status/1263010550339993600">Und überhaupt ist Herr Maaßen der Verfassung und dem Grundgesetz gegenüber eher feindlich eingestellt</a>.</p>

<p>Jetzt bewirft sich der Berliner Verfassungsschutz mal wieder nicht mit Ruhm, <a href="https://www.bento.de/politik/verfassungsschutz-vorwuerfe-gegen-ende-gelaende-sind-teile-der-bewegung-linksextrem-a-7c5ad2d7-7c3e-4b1a-8a17-adf940c1f6d3">indem das Klimaschutzbündnis „Ende Gelände“ als linksextrem eingestuft wird</a>.</p>

<p>Diese und viele weitere Vorfälle lassen mich daran zweifeln, ob der Verfassungsschutz tatsächlich noch den ursprünglichen Auftrag verfolgt, oder mittlerweile nur noch ein weiteres Werkzeug von rechten und neoliberalen Akteuren ist. Und diese Vorstellung gefällt mir überhaupt nicht.</p>

<p>Es ist, meiner Meinung nach, Zeit das Bundesamt und die Ableger in den Ländern einer sehr gründlichen Prüfung zu unterziehen. Alle Personalentscheidungen und Handlungen der letzten paar Jahrzehnte gehören genau unter die Lupe genommen und daraus müssen Konsequenzen gezogen werden.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since going 1× on my gravel bike, I’ve had a couple of instances of dropping my chain on quick and bumpy descents. Pelting down a forest road at 50+ km/h, this was quite scary. It was also a bit surprising because the combination of equipment on the bike is supposed eliminate or heavily reduce the chances of dropping the chain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shimano RD-RX800 clutch rear derailleur</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ethirteen.com/products/xcx-plus-11-speed-cassette">e*thirteen XCX Plus 9–39 11-speed cassette</a></li>
<li>Race Face 32-tooth narrow-wide chain ring</li>
</ul>

<p>The chain dropping only happened in the 9-tooth cog, which led me to think this might be caused by a lack of chain tension combined with the e*thirteen cassette. I got in touch with the e*thirteen support team and received a really great response, pointing out a number of scenarios and ideas for solving this issue: increasing the B screw tension, shortening the chain by a couple of links, or adding a chain guide.</p>

<p>Since I <strong>a)</strong> didn’t want to mess with the B screw too much so as not to degrade shifting performance, <strong>b)</strong> I sized the chain properly, and <strong>c)</strong> a chain guide is also out of the question because it would completely ruin – <em>Ruin! I say!</em> – the clean aesthetics of the bike, I looked for a different solution and I think I found it in a <a href="https://garbaruk.com/race-face-cinch-round-boost.html">Garbaruk chainring</a>.</p>

<p>Garbaruk builds these chainrings with 40% taller teeth and an overall longer tooth profile, as the two photos below show well, I think:</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-VW5bKsb/0/29af4ffe/X4/i-VW5bKsb-X4.jpg" alt="Race Face Cinch system 32-tooth chainring" /></p>

<p>The overall fit of the chain on the chainring is also much tighter and the effect of this has been very positive.</p>

<p>Since mounting the Garbaruk chainring, I have yet to drop the chain, no matter the situation. I hope it’s going to stay that way and I’m curious how quickly the chainring is going to wear down.</p>

<p>Ich bin ja immer auf der Suche nach netten Strecken und insbesonndere nach solchen, die sich auf einem Schotterrad (englisch: gravel bike) gut fahren lassen. Verglichen mit Trier und Umgebung, ist hier um Freiburg (im Breisgau) das Netz an so gut wie ununterbrochenen Waldwegen natürlich bedeutend größer und ich erfreue mich schon sehr daran.</p>

<p>Also fange ich mal an die ein oder andere Runde, die sich bewährt hat, hier einzustellen. Vielleicht findet jemand etwas, dass gefällt.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.ethirteen.com/products/xcx-plus-11-speed-cassette">e*thirteen XCX Plus 9–39 11-speed cassette</a> has been on my gravel bike for over a month now and I’ve ridden over 250 km with it so far. It replaced a Shimano XT CS-M8000 11–40 cassette that I’ve ridden for over a year and countless of kilometres. These are my first impressions of the cassette.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ntZjB3m/0/X3/i-ntZjB3m-X3.jpg" alt="e\*thirteen XCX Plus 9-39 cassette and a Shimano RD-RX800 rear derailleur on a titanium bike" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Shifting is crisper but a bit more fiddly to set up. I don’t know if it’s the higher number of shift gates or the tooth profile but it took me a while to get shifting right on the bike stand. The cassette would react more quickly to less than optimal indexing. Once tuned properly, I found that it shifts quicker, even under load, and the shift action feels more positive.</li>
<li>It’s louder. Not to the point where it annoys me but it took a bit of getting used to. I assume the lightweight construction with the large hollow space amplifies chain noise and shifting sounds.</li>
<li>The cassette feels solid and it has yet to show any signs of wear.</li>
<li>Chain wrap on the 9-tooth cog doesn’t seem to be an issue. I had read this in a couple of places and was worried that going with such a small cog for the highest gear could cause chain skipping but I’ve not had a problem. Mind you, I’m using a Ultegra RD-RX800 rear derailleur and a Shimano 105 11-speed chain (didn’t want to put on a fresh Ultegra chain, just yet) and I’ve properly adjusted the B-screw tension. Even going full-bore on a flat section, putting as much power as I can into it, hasn’t caused any problems (more on that further down).</li>
<li>With the chain on the smallest cog and depending on the chainring used up front (32-tooth and 36-tooth for my bicycles), the chain will be very close to the rear end of the chain stay. Depending on the bike, this may not fit at all. On my Litespeed T5G, I’ve noticed some chain slap going down fast and bumpy descents in the 9-tooth cog, even with a clutch rear derailleur. This is something I’ve never experienced with the 11-tooth cog on the XT cassette and it may be a deal breaker for some.</li>
<li>Lastly, and this is not something I’d ever see myself write: it’s noticeably lighter than the cassette it replaced. Sure, ~ 100 g might not sound like much to a less experienced cyclist such as myself but the back wheel seems just a bit more nimble, riding across bumpy gravel tracks.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all I’m happy with the cassette so far. It’s done exactly what I had hoped it would when converting my bike from a 2× 11 to a 1×11 system. With a 32-tooth chainring up front, the 9–39 spread in the back gives me an ample gear range, an easy 0.82 gear ratio in the lowest gear, a reasonably fast 3.55 gear ratio in the highest gear, and fairly tight and even gear spacing, particularly in the higher gears.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve been so happy with this piece of kit that I bought an e*thirteen cassette for my city/commuter/road bike that has, up until recently, sported a full SRAM NX Eagle group with a 11–50 cassette and a 32-tooth chainring.  I replaced the NX Eagle cassette with the <a href="https://www.ethirteen.com/products/trs-plus-12-speed-cassette">2nd generation TRS Plus 12-speed 9–46 cassette</a> and the front chainring with a 36-tooth (soon 38-tooth).</p>

<p>Based on my initial experiences with the 9–39 on my gravel bike, what drew me to the 9–46 12-speed was <strong>a)</strong> the lower weight, <strong>b)</strong> the greater range of 511% on the e*thirteen compared to 455% on the NX Eagle, while at the same time offering <strong>c)</strong> a much tighter and, in my eyes, more sensible gear spacing in the higher gears. The first six gears on the TRS Plus cassette are <em>9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18</em> where on the NX Eagle the jumps are <em>11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22</em>. My first road ride with the new cassette was a 45 km trip mostly on the road up a local mountain and then down again and I very quickly appreciated the choices made by e*thirteen.<br />
Finally, chain wrap on the 9-tooth cog is perfectly fine with a SRAM Eagle rear derailleur and a GX Eagle chain. I tried a couple of times to produce any kind of skipping, riding at 80 rpm, on a slight incline, pushing 42 km/h (yes, I was very much winded after) and I experienced no issues whatsoever.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to many more kilometres with these cassettes and I’ll write a long term review at a later point.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/02/27/apple-doesnt-care.html">Apple doesn&#39;t care about audio quality my butt, Neil Young</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/02/27/apple-doesnt-care.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-27 11:05:00 &#43;0100">Feb 27, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>By internet time this story is ages old, I know, but I was reminded again that Apple cares about audio quality and why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young">Neil Young</a> is <em>so.very.wrong.</em> 😉<br />
He made a few waves in the tech sphere in late January by stating something to the effect of the Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro having a shit DAC (Digital Analogue Converter) and Apple generally caring more about consumerism than creating high quality audio equipment for professionals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/01/28/neil-young-is-wrong-about-the-macbook-pro/">Jim Dalrymple thoroughly debunked any of the claims made by Young</a> on The Loop weeks ago but I wanted to offer a different example:<br />
<strong>The Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter">Lightning</a>/<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapte">USB-C</a> to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter</strong></p>

<p>Many people make fun of these little dongles and I get it. Apple removed the headphone jack from its iPhone and iPads and replaced it with an easy-to-lose USD 9.— dongle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage">and they called it courage</a>. My feelings about the dongle went from a solid <strong>meh</strong>  (<em>#donglelyfe</em>) to loving these little things, seriously loving them. The reason is simple: they have amazing sound quality.</p>

<p>In more technical terms (<a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/lightning-to-3-5mm-adapter-sound-quality/">source 1</a>, <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/lightning-adapter-audio-quality.htm">source 2</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>The output source impedance measures &gt; 1Ω.</li>
<li>Frequency response is close to perfectly flat.</li>
<li>Harmonic distortion is almost nonexistent across various resistances (Ω).</li>
<li>Dynamic range is on par with previous iPhone headphone jacks, which had great audio quality</li>
</ul>

<p>In less technical terms it means that these little dongles can drive extremely sensitive earphones with no to absolutely minimal changes to the frequency response (their sound signature) on the one hand and can also power full-size headphones on the other hand.
To get this kind of flexibility and sound quality, you&rsquo;d typically have to buy and lug around a dedicated portable DAC.</p>

<p>My earphones of choice are the <a href="https://campfireaudio.com/shop/andromeda/">Campfire Audio Andromeda</a>, great sounding earphones that are very hard to drive properly. Sources with an output resistance of larger than 1Ω will quickly and negatively impact the sound signature, starting with reducing the bass response dramatically.</p>

<p>Using Apple&rsquo;s dongles, they sound brilliant, same as they do on my MacBook Pro. I even use the USB-C dongle to listen to music on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 that I use for work a lot. Its 3.5 mm audio jack is … not good, to be polite. With a USB-A to USB-C adapter and the USB-C audio dongle (again <em>#donglelyfe</em>), I get perfect audio quality listening to losslessly compressed music.</p>

<p>So no, Mr. Young, Apple does care about audio quality even on a consumer level. And what I use for proof are these tiny, easy-to-lose, beautifully sounding, flexible dongles.</p>

			 <p>No no no, hear me out…</p>

<p>It’s crazy how many things I can get done on this little super computer that is my smartphone but sometimes when writing longer texts, particularly email responses, or blog post, <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/386/">or telling someone on the internet how they’re so wrong about something</a> (kidding), having a physical keyboard is a blessing.</p>

<p>So when <a href="https://youtu.be/a9uI-XdP8B8">this video</a> popped up in my youtube recommendations, I thought, yeah no, not something like this because that’s stupid and unusable unless you have very thin fingers.</p>

<p>I’ve found this little old ThinkOutside foldable bluetooth keyboard for Pocket PCs over a year ago for € 30.— and take it with me as a redundancy if my laptop or iPad doesn’t work on a trip. They keys assignments are obviously made for Pocket PCs/Windows CE and the keys are not big but it’s still a huge productivity boost if you really need to write a lot.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5">Psion 5mx</a> was maybe my favourite PDAs back in the day. The keyboard was big enough for some semblance of multi-finger typing and it was a pleasure to type on. If someone where to make a keyboard case for smartphones with a versatile insert system for different smartphones (read: future proofing) and a wired connection (think: adapters for USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB), I’d be all …</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPa2TdahY8LAAxy/giphy.gif" alt="SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY gif" /></p>

<p>I could live with a bluetooth connection too and in that case, add a big battery into the bottom to give it some heft and long battery life.</p>

<p>Alternatively, just make the Palm Foldable Keyboard again (at some point Targus had the rights to it), <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/04/04/repurposing-a-palm-portable-keyboard/">lest I might seriously consider making an adapter for it</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/02/05/fujifilm-just-announced.html">Fujifilm just announced my next camera, the X100V (ARGH!)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/02/05/fujifilm-just-announced.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-05 12:37:00 &#43;0100">Feb 5, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 

<p>Yesterday Fujifilm announced a few new things at their &ldquo;X Summit&rdquo; in London. The most consequential one for me was the announcement of the X100V. It&rsquo;s the fifth generation of the X100 series and it&rsquo;s going to be my next camera.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in love with the concept of the X100 series since shortly after I started shooting with Fujifilm APS-C cameras but it always had too many crucial drawbacks for me to consider actually buying one.</p>

<h4 id="the-lens">The lens</h4>

<p>The first lens I bought for my X-E1 way back when, was the <a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/">XF23mmF1.4 R</a>. I purchased it because after inspecting the photos I had taken with the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM kit lens, I saw that most of my shots were in the 22–24 mm range and I wanted something with a wider aperture to play around with. The 23/1.4 is still the lens I shoot with the most. I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>The lens in the X100 series, while decent, simply didn&rsquo;t have the same versatility. Corner sharpness wasn&rsquo;t very good at f/2 and shooting at close focus distances wide open resulted in very soft pictures. Coming from the XF23mmF1.4 R, that&rsquo;s simply not something I would be able to accept.</p>

<p>(As a side note, the same drawbacks of the X100 lens also apply to the XF23mmF2 R WR lens, albeit not in the severity as found in the X100 series lenses up until now. It&rsquo;s the reason why I sold the lens again after having used it for a few months.)</p>

<h4 id="weather-sealing">Weather sealing</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t begin to say how much I appreciate this on my Fujifilm cameras. I have it on the X-Pro2, on the X-T3, and I had it on the X-T1. I take a camera with me almost everywhere I go in any weather. Be it for a trip downtown or going hiking with my dogs. The cameras and weather sealed lenses have handled everything I&rsquo;ve thrown at them so far and I had hoped Fujifilm would&rsquo;ve added this to the X100F already, but no.</p>

<p>Now, the new X100V is properly weather sealed once you put a protective filter on the lens and that gives you an extremely compact package that you can take anywhere.</p>

<h4 id="flippy-screen">Flippy screen</h4>

<p>Maybe you like it maybe you don&rsquo;t, I like having it and dislike not having it on the X-Pro2. To get this in a camera as small as the X100V is just a nice bonus that only increases the camera&rsquo;s usefulness.</p>

<hr />

<p>After the announcement, I read the excellent <a href="https://jonasraskphotography.com/2020/02/04/fujifilm-x100v-first-look-preview-the-desert-island-camera/">preview written by Jonas Rask</a> and immediately knew that it would be very hard to pass up on the X100V.</p>

<p>Then the first review by Chris and Jordan of DPReview TV was published and that completely sealed the deal. It&rsquo;s worth a watch.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>An observation regarding Fujifilm&rsquo;s product policy</em></p>

<p>Chris Nichols and Jordan Drake mentioned something interesting in the video. Fujifilm has put almost all features found in the very recently released X-Pro3 into the X100V. More than you&rsquo;d typically expect for what is essentially a compact large-sensor camera. Even the video features are solid for the most part.<br />
This really made me happy because it shows that Fujifilm is essentially following Apple&rsquo;s (and particularly Steve Jobs&rsquo;s playbook) for positioning and releasing products:<br />
Instead of artificially separating their product lines to prevent cannibalisation, by limiting the feature sets compared to the flagship products, they let their products cannibalise themselves instead of letting products by other manufacturers do so.
This creates true choice for customers and—to me—is a sign of respect for the customers by the company.</p>

			 <p>Fujifilm continues to give me reasons to like them.</p>

<p>I started the video expecting to see Chris Nichols report on significant differences in optical performance between the € 199,— XC35mmF2 and the € 399,— XF35mmF2 just because <em>capitalism</em>. Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to be wrong and particularly in this case.</p>

<p>Fujifilm is taking the guts of this lens and making it available in an even more affordable package. That is such a great move because it gives a customer the option to decide if they want to spend money on weather sealing and a full metal build without having to compromise on optical quality or autofocus speed.</p>

<p>I have the XF35mmF2 R WR. After failing to take to it in the beginning, I warmed to it when I realised how fast this lens was and how nicely it renders high contrast scenes. It&rsquo;s become my go-to lens for taking pictures when out for walks or hiking with the dog, because I can rely on it focusing quickly on moving subjects and capturing what I see. Then there&rsquo;s the focal length that, while a bit tighter than I typically like, lends itself well for the types of outdoor portraits that I like to shoot. It really is Fujifilm&rsquo;s <a href="https://fstoppers.com/gear/why-you-should-pick-nifty-fifty-lens-199093">Nifty Fifty</a> and such good value for money. I&rsquo;ve shot some of my favourite photos of my furry friends and some great portraits of friends and family with it.</p>

			 <p>Two weeks. Two weeks I couldn’t find a day with weather good enough to take Battle Cat out for a ride. Too much rain to ride in the woods, too windy to ride anywhere in the open without having to fight massive sidewinds and headwinds.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first sunny day of this new year over here and I pounced on the chance to get even a short, mid-day ride in.</p>

<p>It took me longer than expected to get into the groove on this ride and for some reason my heart rate was higher than usual. So instead of overdoing it, I kept it short with a few good climbs.</p>

			 <p>Diese Meldung sah ich heute in meinem Twitter-Stream:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/autogipfel-vda-fordert-milliarden-fuer-branche.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=1090884">Umstellung auf Elektromobilität: VDA verlangt Milliardenhilfen für Autohersteller und Zulieferer.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ich empfinde das als Frechheit und es macht mich traurig. Ich bin Opelanerkind. Teile meiner Familie arbeiten oder arbeiteten in der Automobilindustrie. Trotzdem sage ich, <strong>die deutsche Autoindustrie verdient es zu sterben</strong>, statt Milliardenhilfen zu erhalten.</p>

<p>Diese Industrie entwickelt seit so vielen Jahren völlig am Markt, an den Realitäten des Klimawandels und den Veränderungen bei Transport und Mobilität vorbei, betrügt, drückt sich vor den Konsequenzen des eigenen kriminellen Handelns, lässt sich an allen Ecken und Enden vom Staat subventionieren und übertreibt die eigene Wichtigkeit für den langfristigen wirtschaftlichen Wohlstand dieses Landes.<br />
Und jetzt traut sie es sich nach weiterer Unterstützung zu fragen, obwohl die Fehlentscheidungen und die Jahrzehnte an Missmanagement der Altherrenriege dazu führte, dass die Kacke nun am dampfen ist und dieser gewaltige Haufen Scheiße sich nicht mehr hinter einem Berg an SUVs verstecken lässt.</p>

<p>Es reicht.</p>

<p>Diese Firmen, VW, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Porsche, undwiesiealleheißen, sollen entweder radikale Änderungen durchführen und ernsthafte, realistische und innovative Produkte anbieten, oder sie verdienen es durch andere Firmen ersetzt zu werden und zu Grunde zu gehen.</p>

<p>Ich habe keine Lust, dass meine Steuergelder dafür verschwendet werden Firmen am Leben zu erhalten, deren einziges Ziel es ist Shareholder Value zu generieren und den eigenen Top-Managern Millionengehälter zu zahlen.</p>

<p>Diese Firmen sind für mich als Betriebswirtschaftler der Inbegriff von Versagen: der Ruf nach Subventionen und offenen wie indirekten Drohungen, das Land würde wirtschaftlichen Schaden nehmen, zeugt nicht nur von fehlendem Geschäftssinn und Ideenlosigkeit, sondern auch von purer Feigheit und dem Eingeständnis, dass sie zur Teilnahme an einem tatsächlichen Wettbewerb im Kapitalismus weder fähig noch willens sind.</p>

			 <p>Today went nothing like planned. My partner wanted to go for a 12 km hike with our dogs and I would’ve gotten some gravel biking in. Instead we had to take Bijou (12 years) to the vet for what appears to be an episode of canine idiopathic vestibular disease. Poor pup.</p>

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2020/01/09/two-interesting-concepts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-01-09 01:45:00 &#43;0100">Jan 9, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>CES 2020 is in full swing and two things Dell announced—or rather teased—have me intrigued:</p>

<p>The <strong>Concept Duet</strong> with its two 13.4 inch full HD touch displays and a traditional keyboard that you can put on one of the sides when you don&rsquo;t want to type on glass absolutely looks like something is would use. I think it’s a great idea to have two screens that allow for adaptive interaction with content and controls and the option to read on it like a big book when I want to.
This entire class of devices that Microsoft has been attempting to generate hype for since their last developer conference could become a really interesting computing experience.</p>

</div>


<p>Alienware&rsquo;s <strong>Concept UFO</strong> is a gaming PC shrunk down and put into a device that looks and works like a Nintendo Switch. This is certainly a more ambitious project and less likely to ever become a viable product compared to the dual screen laptop Concept Duet. After reading and watching the coverage of this early stage concept, I can&rsquo;t help but hope that it won&rsquo;t stay just a concept but become a real thing. I&rsquo;ve been playing <em>Star Wars – Jedi: Fallen Order</em> on a loaned PS4 and the thought of having this type of game on a handheld console that I can also attach to my TV if I want to is more than a little exciting.</p>

			 <p>With the weather as good as it was, I decided to get in one last ride this year. Nothing fancy just 40+ km on tarmac.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-g3N57sj/0/e6684c66/X4/i-g3N57sj-X4.jpg" alt="A road bike handlebar with two winter gloves stuck to the ends and a road in the backgrpund" title="Tea break in a sunny spot" /></p>

<p>It was a good ride and I kept grinning riding along a road between the villages of Franzenheim and Kernscheid — at least on the inside because on the outside my expression was a bit pained from going uphill. I discovered this piece of asphalt a few weeks after my trip to Scotland in 2018 and it reminded me so much of the singletrack roads over there (the only thing missing are the passing places).</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-R9MCrRd/0/c7830480/X4/i-R9MCrRd-X4.jpg" alt="a wide field, the slightly cloudy sky in the background and a fallen over tree on the left" title="View onto a field along a singletrack road between Franzenheim and Kernscheid" /></p>

<p>I was really lucky because while temperatures for most of the ride were below 0°C, it was dry and I only encountered a few spots of frozen ground.</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Wbh6pjf/0/b8a14a4a/X4/i-Wbh6pjf-X4.jpg" alt="picture shot diagonally through a bridge in the winter sunlight" title="Bridge along the Ruwer bike path" /></p>

<p>And I have to say: I might not enjoy road cycling a lot but one distinct advantage to gravel cycling is not having to clean my bike after the ride.</p>

			 <p>We met up with a friend and her dog on a hilltop fairly close to our place for a morning walk. The weather promised some nice photo opportunities, so I took my X-T3 and the 35/2 lens with me. Not only was it a nice walk with great company, the pictures I got out of it didn’t disappoint, either.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t decide between using the Astia, ProNeg High, and Classic Chrome film simulations in a lot of places, so the pictures above are a mix of them.</p>

<p>Over the past week three upcoming movies had their trailers released that I just cannot wait to see in the cinema.</p>

<h4 id="james-bond-no-time-to-die">James Bond — No Time To Die</h4>

<p>This is, once again, supposed to be the last Bond movie starring Daniel Craig in the leading role as James Bond. I may have grown up with Pierce Brosnan&rsquo;s Bond but I still consider Craig to be &ldquo;my Bond&rdquo;. His portrayal of the character and the movies as a whole have brought a new grittyness, realism, and emotional component to the franchise that I find very enjoyable.<br />
Still, I think the Bond movies need a bit of a shake-up and for that reason, I&rsquo;m very excited to see a female <code>00</code> agent in the next film. I really hope we&rsquo;ll be treated to the mantle of James Bond being handed to someone who&rsquo;s not a white male actor.</p>

</div>


<h4 id="black-widow">Black Widow</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad that this wasn&rsquo;t released before the character of Black Widow has been sacrificed in &ldquo;Avengers: Endgame&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s coming nonetheless. My secret hope is that they&rsquo;re not going to hold back on the character and explore some of Romanoff&rsquo;s past misdeeds and her quest to clear the red in her ledger.</p>

</div>


<h4 id="wonder-woman-1984">Wonder Woman 1984</h4>

<p>This came out yesterday and I was squealing like a little girl. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about the fact they&rsquo;re bringing back her love interest and I&rsquo;m also not sure if I need another look back, I think I&rsquo;d rather see Diana Prince/Wonder Woman kick ass in the present after the events of &ldquo;Justice League&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Es ist irgendwie jedes mal das Gleiche: ich möchte etwas per Internet bestellen, finde einen Onlineshop mit angeblich zügiger <em>Lieferzeit</em>, kaufe den Artikel und dann heißt es warten.</p>

<p>Meistens kommt im Laufe von 24 Stunden eine E-Mail die mir mitteilt, dass die Ware versandt wurde. In Vorfreude öffne ich die E-Mail, klicke auf den Sendungsverfolgungslink und … … … bin enttäuscht.</p>

<p>Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, wann ich in den letzten Jahren etwas im Internet bestellt habe und mit dem Eintreffen der &ldquo;Versandbestätigung&rdquo; war die Ware auch tatsächlich in den Händen des Versanddienstleisters. Fast immer ist der Status, den ich sehe ein <strong>&ldquo;Die Sendung wurde dem Versanddienstleister elektronisch angekündigt.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Es gibt genug Onlineshops, bei denen weiß ich, dass wenn ein Artikel lagernd verfügbar ist und ich vor 14:00 Uhr bestelle, die Sendung tatsächlich am gleichen Tag auf den Weg kommt. Es gibt aber auch genug andere Läden im Netz, bei denen zwischen der Ankündigung der Sendung bei <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUV3KvnvT-w">DHL, Hermes, DPD, UPS, etc.</a> und dem tatsächlichen Paketausgang durchaus einige Tage vergehen können, selbst wenn das Produkt auf Lager ist.</p>

<p>Ich frage mich in solchen Momenten dann immer ob die Onlineshops wirklich denken, dass es in ihrem Interesse ist, wenn ein Kunden sich kurze Zeit nach der Bestellung verarscht fühlt. Es kann nicht so schwer sein, den automaticshen Versand einer E-Mail-Versandbestätigung an den Status <strong>&ldquo;Die Sendung ist im Verteilzentrum eingetroffen und wird für den Weitertransport in die Zielregion vorbereitet.&rdquo;</strong> eines Versandunternehmens zu koppeln.<br />
Für mich als Kunden würde das weniger höhnisch, deutlich aufrichtiger wirken, und die E-Mail hätte einen tatsächlichen Informationswert.</p>

<p>After my <a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2019/11/13/mm-my-beautiful.html">failed experiment of trying to mount 650b wheels on Battle Cat</a>, my gravel bike, I couldn’t get the idea of having two wheel sets out of my head; one for off road riding and one for road use.</p>

<p>After a bit of searching on eBay classifieds, I found a lightly used (e.g. ridden for ~ 700 km) set of <a href="https://www.dtswiss.com/en/products/wheels-road/cross-road/cr-1600-spline/cr-1600-spline-23/">DT Swiss CR 1600 SPLINE 23</a> wheels for a decent price. These things don’t come cheap when new and the person selling them had used them on a Canyon Inflite AL as well, before upgrading to carbon rims.</p>

<p>For me, this is ideal because <strong>a)</strong> I know that these will fit my bike well, <strong>b)</strong> changing between wheels for road and off road use is going to be almost seamless with no need to readjust the brakes or the rear derailleur (I’m using the same Shimano XT CS-M8000 11–40 cassette on the road set up, and <strong>c)</strong> these rims will likely last me for years.<br />
I’ve ridden the existing set I have hard over the past two years and while they do have a couple of scratches and one of two dings, I have not yet managed to get them out of true.
In addition to that the DT Swiss Ratchet freewheel system is great to ride and easy to service. Having it on both wheel sets is another bonus.</p>

<p>Oh and my <a href="https://www.donnellycycling.com/products/xplor-mso-folding-120-tpi">Clement/Donelly X’Plor MSO</a> tyres have made a quicker comeback than I expected. Yes, they’re not dedicated road tyres but they are starting to show signs of age anyway and I’m going to use them for winter riding, enjoying the extra grip they provide, instead of buying a new pair of road rubber.</p>

			 <p>We visited family over the weekend in a rather unplanned manner. On Saturday the weather was better than expected and we immediately used this opportunity to fuel up on some sun.<br />
The northern part of the <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=Kottenforst,%20Deutschland&amp;auid=14052093084222261622&amp;ll=50.663841,7.022925&amp;lsp=6489&amp;q=Kottenforst&amp;_ext=ChkKBQgEEIEBCgQIBRADCgQIBhADCgQIChAMEiYpenTZj2VUSUAxzftsGzgQHEA5+En/64tVSUBBURr9MbseHEBQAw%3D%3D&amp;t=m">Kottenforst</a> forest has suffered in the storms over the past few years and a lot of trees had to be cut down so it’s not the prettiest area to take a walk in right now but the seasons&rsquo;s characterstics and low standing sun made for beautiful views.<br />
I still find it hard to edit high-contrast scenes forest scenery like this to properly capture what I saw and the mood of the moment but these two came out pretty well.</p>

<p>Our two dogs (only Mika pictured here) had a lot of fun and their noses got a good workout because there’s still many wild animals in that area. Mika cracks me up every time because unless you capture her in action, she always looks like she&rsquo;s posing.</p>

<p>(For those interested, all photos were shot with the Fujifilm X-Pro2 with the XF35mmF2 R WR lens and edited in Lightroom mobile with the Velvia film simulation. Side note about the last part: I find that LR&rsquo;s version of Velvia has a slightly too strong magenta tinge so I typically remove 5–15 points in the white balance settings.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Wednesday, in an attempt to make good use of the surprisingly sunny weather, I took my gravel bike out for a first ride with the <a href="https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/nano-40c">WTB Nano 40</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2019/b7f188e8fb.jpg" alt="Wtb NANO 40 on DT Swiss CR1600 Spline db 23 wheels in the forest" title="wtb_nano_40-on-dt_swiss_wheel.jpeg" border="0" width="1024" height="1280" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2019/11/13/mm-my-beautiful.html">My recent experiment of using 650b × 47 mm tyres on my bike</a> failed due to tyre rub on the left chain stay, yes, but it gave me a taste of what wider, higher-volume tyres with an aggressive tread could do for riding gravel and some tame singletrack. So after doing some research on 700×40c rubber, I had high hopes for the WTB NANO 40.</p>

<p>(I set up the tyres tubeless with <a href="https://muc-off.com/products/no-puncture-hassle-tubeless-sealant">Muc-Off&rsquo;s No Puncture Hassle Tubeless Sealant</a> and inflated them to 37 psi up front and 38 psi in the back referencing the handy <a href="https://www.enve.com/en/tirepressure/">tubeless tire pressure
recommendations published by ENVE</a>.)</p>

<p>For this outing I put together a 20 km route that I had ridden before, at least in parts, comprised of fire roads, some root-y singletrack, a few fast descents on what I thought was going to be either fire roads or well-worn foot paths. The bad news is that some of the paths had been shut down years ago and were very much overgrown and hard to navigate, the good news is that I was not only able to try the NANO 40 on loose, muddy, sloshy, puddle-dotted forest roads, I was also treated to a crazy fast descent on a 3 km hard pack and relatively dry gravel road.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2019/77c55c278f.jpg" alt="Ride on 20191120" title="ride-on-20191120.jpeg" border="0" width="1074" height="1074" /></p>

<p>After finishing the ride, I was left with two dominant feelings from this first experience with the NANO 40:</p>

<ol>
<li>What an insanely fun ride. These tyres did such a good job and provided loads of grip even in ankle-deep mud.</li>
<li>You idiot. You had considered buying these almost two years ago when you replaced the Schwalbe X-One 33 mm tyres on the Canyon Inflite AL that brought you to gravel cycling in the first place but you didn&rsquo;t do it because you were too chicken about trying a tubeless setup and the tread looked too aggressive.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So what did I learn?</strong></p>

<p>For one that tubeless setups are the way to go for me moving forward, it seems.<br />
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the Donnelly X&rsquo;Plor MSO 700×40c 120 TPI tube tyres I&rsquo;ve ridden so far are crazy good. Having now ridden a properly supple and comparatively aggressively treaded tyre, I appreciate them even more. For a tubed tyre, they are very comfortable and robust even when ridden below the manufacturers specification of ~ 50 psi and they offer great traction within their limits.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the realisation that once the fear of pinch flats is reduced and I embrace lower pressures, it opens up a lot more paths to ride. That said, I am going to increase the pressure in the back wheel for the next ride to 40 psi, because at 38 psi, it sometimes squirmed too much beneath me especially on faster, slightly rockier roads.</p>

<p>Lastly that I felt the NANO 40 provides a very good mix of a fast rolling 700c tyre and some serious grip on loose ground that the WTB Sendero 47 got me hooked on.</p>

<p>Oh and they look oh so nice on my bike 😏</p>

			 <p>My colleague and friend Mike sent me a link to an <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">interview with Phil Schiller on c|net conducted by Roger Cheng</a>. The core part of the interview concerns the new 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple&rsquo;s butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller&rsquo;s answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we&rsquo;ll go down that path.</p>

<p>iPad benefits because we assume that you need to be able to do most everything with touch, and we don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that experience. Mac assumes you want to do most everything with a keyboard and mouse input. We don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that path. You can look at some of the other products that will try to go halfway between the two. They end up just compromising experiences. That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a 12.9&rdquo; 3rd generation iPad Pro. It&rsquo;s a device that&rsquo;s as close to my teenage self&rsquo;s Star Trek P.A.D.D. dream as I could hope for. But what drove me to stop using iPads for a couple of years after the iPad Air 2 and what still bugs me, even in iPadOS, are the limitations Apple places on the software of the device and on the capabilities of third party software. The way Schiller frames the separation between iPads and Macs is based on the type of input and that, to me, misses the point.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way. When I was shopping for a new tablet at the beginning of the year, the decision to go for the top-of-the-line iPad Pro instead of an infinitely more capable Surface Pro 6 came down to two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I put a gigantic amount of faith and € 2,000+ in Apple, hoping they would come through and at least add support for external storage with the next major release, as had been speculated. Thankfully, iPadOS delivered.</li>
<li>The quality of third party software on iOS (and macOS), particularly from indie developers and once you venture outside of the big name applications, is still completely unmatched on Windows and in all areas: touch-friendliness, UX and UI design, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>On this I agree with Schiller: it&rsquo;s important to have proper support for touch and proper support for mouse + keyboard in the devices you offer.<br />
The best example sits in front of me daily; my lovely Surface Pro 2. This is a full-fledged Windows PC with all of the potential you expect it to have but using the operating system and third party applications in touch mode is a compromise at best and impossible at worst (and don&rsquo;t even get me started on the schizophrenic nature of Windows 10 itself with a Settings app <em>and</em> the Control Panel app).<br />
But the above also goes to show that it&rsquo;s not a matter of the devices&rsquo; form factor or input methods but a matter of having the operating system expose as much potential to the software running on it and enforcing a high standard of optimisation for the form factor and input methods.</p>

<p>Comparing a modern Surface Pro 7 to a current iPad Pro leaves me with this conclusion:</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 limits how comfortably I can accomplish my tasks but iPadOS still limits what tasks I can accomplish.</strong></p>

<p>And this is what I continue to have issues with, this is the thing that drives me to pick up my MacBook Pro or my Surface Pro 2 for tasks as trivial as using some necessary extension in a browser like Brave <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, <em>or</em> quickly converting a video file I created on my camera into a different format, <em>or</em> adding new music to the Music app on my iPad, <em>or</em> inspecting the code of my website right in the browser I&rsquo;m using. Tasks that the iPad, as a device, is absolutely capable of but that iPadOS keeps me from doing.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<hr />

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">I am fully aware of the fact that allowing extensions and other features common on Windows and macOS needs to be done carefully because of the security and privacy implications. That still doesn&rsquo;t excuse, in my opinion, why Apple hasn&rsquo;t made any visible efforts to solve these problems on a platform that&rsquo;s been around for over 12 years.

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago I had the idea to buy a second wheel set for Battle Cat, my gravel bike, to expand the where I can ride it. The plan was to keep the 700c wheel set I’ve been riding for the past two years for longer gravel rides or for road riding (using road tyres, obviously). I would then buy a 650b/27.5” wheel set and a pair of wider tyres with more bite to venture into more gnarly terrain.</p>

<p>I inquired with the frame manufacturer what tyre width would be safe to use in the frame and set out to find a good, used wheel set from DT Swiss because I’ve had nothing but great experiences with these so far. After being told that 1.9“ or 4.83 cm wide tyres should work and still provide enough clearance, I quickly settled on the <a href="https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/sendero">WTB Sendero 650b × 47 mm</a> pneus.</p>

<p>The result was this sexy setup:</p>

<p><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-cBcFvv7/0/X4/i-cBcFvv7-X4.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="My gravel bike Battle Cat with 650b wheels and WTB Sendero tyres" /></p>

<p>The wheel set I found was an older pair DT Swiss M1700 MTB wheels with a decent internal rim width and the Ratchet Free Hub System. There was a bit of a setback when I found out that the last person to service the hind wheel didn’t just fail to remove a massive radial run-out, they also centred the rim over the hub body and not over the axle, resulting in a rim that was too far on the left. After getting this fixed for a good amount of money, putting the tyres on tubeless and the wheels into the frame, I saw that it was a tight fit but doable with no tyre rub on the frame or fork.</p>

<p>Well, that changed after the first 15 km of singletrack riding on Saturday. I pushed the tyres the way you would and to my great dismay, they expanded/deformed in a way that caused tyre rub on the left chain stay twice in one revolution on a perfectly true back wheel.</p>

<p>What I’m left with is the choice to either sell the wheel set and tyres again or to find slightly smaller but equally gnarly tyres for the wheels. The problem here, of course, is that smaller tyres also mean an even smaller wheel diameter and a further lowering of the bottom bracket, something that already took getting used to going from 700×40c to 584×47c on the Litespeed T5 Gravel frame I&rsquo;m riding.</p>

<p>There’s one silver lining to all of this, albeit a fact that left me with a very substantial urge to slam my head into my desk repeatedly because I could&rsquo;ve saved myself the trouble of buying another wheel set:<br />
I started checking out which 700×40c rubber is available that would give me better grip on wet forest floor than the Donnelly X&rsquo;Plor MSO I love so much. I found a number of options, the <a href="https://www.wtb.com/products/nano-40c">WTB Nano 40 </a> being the supposed best among them when set up tubeless. The only issue is that WTB recommends running these tyres on a rim with at least 20 mm internal width and my <a href="DT Swiss - CR 1600 SPLINE® 23">DT Swiss CR1600 Spline db</a> wheels are 22 mm wide externally … … … or so I thought.<br />
Turns Out ™ I had misread the specs of the wheels because the spec sheet of the bike I bought them on didn&rsquo;t specify whether the 22 mm were internal or external width figures. Long story short, they have an internal width of 22 mm, meaning they are right in the goldilocks zone width not just for the WTB Nano 40 but for many other ~ 40 mm wide, supple gravel tyres.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m likely going to try and get my hands on the Nanos if I can find them for a decent price and maybe, just maybe I&rsquo;ll get my wish of a gravel bike capable of some gnarlier paths but still fast when I need it to be.</p>

<p>Goodbye 650b wheels, I hardly knew ye.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I came across an article by Geoffrey A. Fowler in the Washington Post titled „<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/08/everyones-airpods-will-die-weve-got-trick-replacing-them/">Everyone’s AirPods will die. We’ve got the trick to replacing them.</a>“ (thanks to Dave Mark of The Loop for bringing it up).</p>

<p>Sadly, the title is not just slightly clickbait-y, it also belies the sensible discussion about the viability of AirPods the article contains. Fowler goes into detail about how and when the batteries in AirPods tend to stop performing and then dives into an analysis of the economic circumstances and environmental implications of a product like the AirPods.</p>

<p>Fowler quotes a rule by Kyle Wiens, CEO of the repair website iFixit.com, that has stuck with me for the past few days:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The life span of an expensive, resource-intensive gadget shouldn’t be limited to the life span of one consumable component. You wouldn’t buy an electric toothbrush where you couldn’t replace the brush. Or a car with glued-on tires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly and also predictably, the new AirPods Pro are made to be just as disposable as their predecessors (and just like any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market right now).</p>

<p>I bought my AirPods a little over two years ago. These little things are a brilliant gadget with decent sound and when pairing works as it should, they&rsquo;re the pinnacle of convenience. They’ve also been in almost daily use since I purchased them then and the battery life is accordingly bad at this point: I get less than 1.5 hours of listening or calls out of them nowadays.<br />
When I purchased them, I knew full well that the battery was not replaceable and to be honest, I’m kind of mad at myself that I put convenience over the longevity, repairability, and recyclability of a device. Typically everything I buy needs to be either repairable and if for some reason that’s not feasible, it has be long-lasting and recyclable.<br />
Case in point: in writing this article I remembered that I bought a pair of EarPods a couple of days after they were released in September 2012 and that pair lasted me almost six years — yes, I treat my earphones carefully.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep using my AirPods until the finally give out or rather until the battery life is so bad that it negates any kind of convenience these truly wireless earphones offer and I’m going to go back to wired earphones with an in-line remote for casual listening. I still have two pairs of completely new EarPods that came with my iPhones over the years in a drawer (one with the lightning plug and one with a standard 3.5 mm plug), or I might splurge on the <a href="https://campfireaudio.com/shop/comet/">Campfire Audio Comet</a>.</p>

			 <p>Two comprehensive reviews of the <a href="https://quoc.cc/collections/gravel-bike-shoes">Quoc Gran Tourer</a> have cropped up on sites that I frequently read.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/quoc-gran-tourer-review/">Quoc Gran Tourer Review: Rocks, Gravel, Dust, And Puddles</a></em><br />
by Cass Gilbert on Bikepacking.com</p>

by John Watson on The Radavist</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Quoc Gran Tourer for over a year now and up until I saw these two reviews, I had thought of writing my own but I found that the assessment of the shoes by these two persons mirrors my own closely enough that there are only two things I would add:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fit wise, I have moderately wide feet and I appreciate having ample room in the toe box. The Gran Tourers deliver in this area, all the while the lacing system allows me to perfectly tie the shoes so they&rsquo;re comfortable yet stay firmly on my feet all day long.</li>
<li>It takes quite a bit for water to seep into these shoes but once they&rsquo;re wet, it takes very long for them to properly dry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taken these shoes through quite a lot yet they still show only minimal signs of wear on the upper and they&rsquo;ve only gotten more comfortable with use. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the shoes.</p>

			 <p>When I built up my gravel bike, Battle Cat, I decided to stick with the <a href="https://www.canyon.com/de-de/gear/components/handlebars-and-stems/handlebars/canyon-h17-al-ergo-lenker/9100883.html">Canyon H17 Al Ergo</a> handlebar at least for a while because I wasn‘t keen on re-wrapping a new bar and I had, up until then, been pretty happy with it. Recent longer outings with more singletrack sections made me curious about the flared drop bars that have become increasingly popular among gravel and cross cyclists. After quite a bit of research, I decided to buy the <a href="https://salsacycles.com/components/category/road_handlebars/cowchipper_deluxe">Salsa Cowchipper Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2019/12717edaa0.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I went out for the first proper ride and the route I picked was a mix of gravel tracks, forest and wine yard paths, and some broken asphalt roads. All of it wet, slippery, loose, and muddy from three days of nearly constant heavy rain.</p>

<p>On the first kilometre everything felt strange. The suddenly angled hoods and brake levers, the flare of the bars (24°), the different transition from the flat bar to the hood to the drops, and all of it combined with the <a href="https://www.tune.de/cockpit/zubehoer-cockpit/dahu-skin">Tune Dahu Skin</a> bar tape.<br />
This completely evaporated once I went up the first singletrack climb. The path was parts muddy, parts wet slippery slate pieces that required careful line choice going up and equally careful weight distribution so as not to lose traction riding on 700×40c Donnelly X’Plor MSO tyres already at 3.5 bar.<br />
The flared bars allowed me to get into a wide and low stance, staying seated the whole time. The first fast decent on a muddy path increased the feeling of control on the bike and sections that I would have typically ridden with my hands on the hoods, I took in the drops because the reduced distance between hoods and drops, combined with the overall different shape of the assembly had me riding less hunched over.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2019/572db40635.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" /></p>

<p>So far so good. I’m going for a longer gravel ride on the weekend that will hopefully be less wet and I’m looking forward to seeing how I feel about the handlebar after 40+ km in the saddle compared to a quick 16 km ride.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2019/09/04/quick-review-topeak.html">Quick review: Topeak ROADIE DA G and 700×40c tyres</a></h1>

<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2019/d2779d251d.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" /></p>

<p>In your typical cyclist&rsquo;s quest to simplify my setup and reduce the things that I carry on rides, I went out to look for a compact, pocketable pump with an integrated pressure gauge. There are a number of options, but none of them have had particularly good reviews – at least not judging by what I was able to find.  Most annoyingly, very few reviews even consider the accuracy of the integrated gauge, stating that it&rsquo;s good enough for (off-)road side repairs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/mini-pumps/1142-roadie-da-g">Topeak ROADIE DA G</a> is a fairly recent release and being happy with a few other of their products, I decided to give it a go.</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>The pump pushes air into the tyre when pushing and pulling on the barrel, which, theortically should help fill the tyre more quickly. The barrel is made out of aluminium, other parts of the pump are made from shock-resistant plastic. Being a road bike pump, it&rsquo;s equipped with a Presta valve head.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used this pump fairly extensively at this point and all things considered, it&rsquo;s a good pump. It&rsquo;s compact, doesn&rsquo;t stick out of a jersey pocket too far and even fits into some saddle bags. The included bottlge cage mount is solid and has held up across a number of hard gravel rides already.</p>

<p>I was very happy to find that the pressure gauge is quite accurate. Comparing it with a dedicated digital gauge and the gauge in my floor pump, it yielded almost identical results when I aimed to hit 𝑥.0 Bar or 𝑥.𝑥 Bar on the gauge. This allowes me to much more accurately and quickly get my tyres up to the desired pressure than doing the &ldquo;pump, pump, pump, detach pump, attach gauge, check pressure, detach gauge, pump some more, check again&rdquo; spiel.</p>

<p>One thing I consider a downside is the pump&rsquo;s barrel getting very hot when reaching pressures of 3.2 Bar and up. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s fine when you&rsquo;re wearing gloves but more than a couple of times when nearing 4 Bar, I had to stop pumping to let the barrel cool down a bit.</p>

<h3 id="suitability-for-700-40c-tyres">Suitability for 700×40c tyres</h3>

<p>The bigger issue from my perspective is the suitability for tyres typically used on gravel bikes. Both my bikes use 700×40c and I tend to vary the pressure depending on the terrain I ride on. Getting this kind of pneu to a pressure beyond 3.5 Bar is hard work and both the pump and I struggle with it.</p>

<p>This issue isn&rsquo;t limited to the ROADIE DA G, however. Right now, most manufacturers of pumps distinguish between high-volume pumps for mountain bike tyres, and high-pressure pumps for road bikes. Tyres for gravel bikes/adventure bikes/bicycle touring fall somewhere in between and I haven&rsquo;t yet seen any pump that delivers good results for 700×36c–700×50c tyres.</p>

A more or less coordinated but definitely intense campaign has been going on online for a number of years now that primes young males to fall for and consider right wing, fascist, hateful ideologies and the groups that propagate them their only safe haven, the only place that understands them. This exploits a pervasive culture of toxic masculinity and preys on young males in their fragile emotional states, driven by their craving for recognition and acceptance.</p>

<p>The thread explores a number of avenues are used by hate groups and right wing radicals and proposes a few ways to combat this. Please read it and if you&rsquo;re inclined follow the various links to similar research and journalistic coverage of this radicalization campaign.</p>

<p>All storylines from season two have an impact on the new season and the themes of friendship and betrayal, duty and perceived destiny, self-esteem and the need to belong, carry over and continue to inform the actions of the characters.Even with this heavy focus on the characters and their relationships, each episode moves the main storyline forward, towards a clear confrontation with high stakes at the end.</p>
<p>I don't feel like I even need to say much about the animation style and quality; it's that good.</p>
<p>This was an absolute delight and I can't recommend this reimagination of She-Ra highly enough. Without spoiling anything, the last episode opens up the universe of the series and I already look forward to season four.</p>

			 <p>This ride turned out harder than expected but it was still fun for a number of reasons:  <br />1. My stamina is improving. Not only did I survive an unplanned and slightly sketchy climb on a largely unused fire road after I took a wrong turn, I later also managed to hold a 46+13 gearing and ~ 89 rpm on a flat paved road with a headwind for 8 km.<br />2. Planning the trip, Komoot added two pieces of trail to the ride that I didn’t know about. One really nice and flowy part of forest singletrack and one ascent that I always wondered about when taking my regular route through the Mattheiser Wald; it looked too overgrown to ride on my gravel bike but is actually an almost mellow ascent but for the loose gravel.<br />3. One of my goals was to buy a bottle of whisky because I’ve been out of that particular one for a while. I managed to snag a bottle, so carrying my insanely heavy lock with me for this tour was worth it after all.<br />4. Still not happy with the way I carry my Fujifilm X70 with me on rides but very much happy I brought it. The photo files are so much more flexible than what my iPhone offers, even when shooting RAW.</p>

			 <p>I think my gravel bike is finally complete.
I had a perfectly good stem and stem cap on the bike before but for some reason I didn&rsquo;t like the diameter of the stem tube in relation to the diameter of the seat post. It didn&rsquo;t look right. So… I replaced it with the &ldquo;Tune Geiles Teil 4.0&rdquo; stem and a CNC-machined Tune stem cap that matches the colour of the Chris King headset quite well.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gone a little bit crazy with the red anodized parts on this bike but then again, I love how it looks and if I&rsquo;m perfectly honest, yes, the bike has to ride well but I also have to like looking at it.</p>

<p>All while installing these parts and doing a few other bits of maintenance on the bike, I couldn&rsquo;t get <a href="https://song.link/i/1159522467">this song</a> out of my head. 🎶 🚵‍♂️</p>

			 <p>This week’s WWDC is going to be a make-or-break situation for me. It’s going to determine whether I will continue to consider Apple’s tablets worthwhile or if I’m going to move to a Microsoft Surface Pro once they release one with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3.</p>

			 <p>So here’s a rather disappointing thing I learned about myself recently:<br />
Attempting to do medium to hard cardio efforts cycling or running in the morning with a total calorie expenditure of 1,000+ will leave me tired all day and cause me to have to drink more coffee or strong tea than usual to stay awake and concentrated.<br />
Doing a longer and hard set of high intensity interval training (bodyweight or with weights) between 500 to 1,200 calories will leave me physically exhausted and my muscles burning but awake and refreshed.<br />
I consider this unfortunate because I love cycling in the mornings, setting out right before sunrise and cycling somewhere interesting.</p>

<p>Anyone curious about really good vegan dishes needs to check out “Thug Kitchen”. It’s my favourite cook book, even beating Action Bronson’s “Fuck That’s Delicious”.</p>

			 <p>I just cancelled my Amazon Prime membership.</p><p>As for so many other people, using Amazon's consumer facing services has started to leave a bad taste in my mouth, seeing how atrociously they treat warehouse staff, the negative impact their business has on the delivery drivers of various logistics companies, and the myriad of other small or large bad things this company is doing or is complicit in because it makes them money.</p><p>A few weeks ago I received an email telling me that the credit card Amazon had on file for Prime membership payments was no longer valid and to update the payment settings lest I want to lose my Prime benefits by 12 January 2019.<br>The holidays gave me some time to think about how many of Amazon's services I use daily and consciously and I found that it was too many. Ignoring Amazon services I use by proxy, like AWS servers, here goes:</p><ul><li>Amazon.de and Amazon Marketplace for shopping</li><li>Amazon Prime for fast shipping</li><li>Amazon Prime Video for streaming</li><li>Amazon Kindle for reading ebooks</li><li>Amazon's Audible for audio books.</li></ul><p>With cancelling my Amazon Prime membership, I'm losing access to Prime shipping and Prime Video. Since I've started reducing the amount of things I buy on or through Amazon about a year ago, the former isn't too much of a loss for me. When streaming through Amazon Prime, my partner and I have used her Prime account anyway, so there's no loss for me there, either, until she makes a decision regarding her Amazon Prime account. This could happen sooner rather than later because we use Netflix much more than Prime Video.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how easy it'll be eschewing shopping on Amazon.de entirely and choosing different online shops but I'm not worried about this. The more difficult task will be finding proper replacements for getting ebooks comfortably and finding a good ereader for them. Finding a replacement for Audible will be similarly difficult. And with the latter two there's also the problem of DRM for the things I've already bought on the platforms.</p>

			 <p>“Hike me.”, is what this beautifully lit forest path says to me.
I went by there recently, walking a different hiking path and when whenever I scroll past this picture I want to grab my bike and explore this forest.
(Side note: I’m getting better at editing high-contrast forest scenes to me liking.)</p>

My feet stayed dry and I was impressed.</p>

			 <p><p>These two trailers hit within the last few days and while I really can&rsquo;t wait to watch &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, the excitement for &quot;Avengers – Endgame&quot; is bitter sweet.<br>
Marvel has built up an amazing franchise starting with the first Iron Man movie. It has spawned an entire universe of movies, TV series, and other media that have entertained me for ten years. I really wonder how they are going to end this chapter with the last Avengers movie and what the next chapter will bring.</p>

			 <p>I can't believe how many pictures I shot in this month that I really wanted to keep and even print. Picking stuff to publish was even harder which is why I'm going to group the pictures in two sections; close-ups and animals.</p>
<h3 id="closeups">Close-ups</h3>
<p>I had bought the Fujifilm 16 mm macro extension ring again after having returned it once before. The first time around I simply didn't know how to approach shooting with it but after some reading and really just having walks with close-ups in mind, it clicked.</p>

<h3 id="animals">Animals</h3>
<p>The first picture in here still classifies as a close-up, being shot with the macro extension ring and the XF90mmF2 R WR but it's also the picture of a bumble bee butt that I was super happy to capture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2017-03/i-GtJDn2W/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/44939f98eb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Many of the vineyards around here have dry stone walls which serve as perfect homes for various critters and this little lizard is one of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2017-03/i-r9W6tth/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/6bcd225ba3.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And almost no photo post of mine is complete without a few pictures of dogs. The first picture must be one of my favourite shots of all time, capturing what is in my mind, the most photogenic dog I know. He's absolutely clueless and kind but was very patient with me.</p>

			 <p><p>Another brilliant segment produced by John Oliver&rsquo;s team. It&rsquo;s something people in the U.S. should watch because their country is being turned into an authoritarian regime piece by piece, day by day. The institutions John Oliver mentions as protecting U.S. citizens from the bad impulses of Trump are being steadily dismantled by him and his cronies.</p>
<p>If the people this country don&rsquo;t stand up and start to work against it, they will soon find themselves in a country with no law but the word of their Führer. The poor sods who helped him gain power, the ones cheering for him at his <s>Nuremberg Rally</s> rallies, cheering for the abuse he screams at the press, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and any other enemy-of-the-day Trump conjures, will be the first to suffer once the economy plummets completely because the kleptocratic swamp Trump has created looted the country for everything that it was worth, and they will be the first ones he sends to die if he starts a war to distract from his domestic failures.</p>

			 <p><p>Ich habe seit etwas über einem Jahr wieder enorm Spaß am Radfahren und bin beim Fahrradtyp CX/Gravel hängengeblieben. Leider sind viele Strecken auf Komoot eher für Mountainbikes ausgelegt und mit einem ungefederten CX-Rad kommt man da häufig weder gut rauf, noch gesund runter (selbst, wenn ich als Streckentyp &quot;Fahrrad mit Schotter&quot; angebe).</p>
<p>Ich bastele mir also seit einiger Zeit so meine eigenen Touren und teile hier meine erste, fertige Tour. Sie verbringt viel Zeit auf Schotterpfaden, Waldautobahnen, in den Weinbergen, und unbefestigten Wegen im Wald. Außerdem gibt es am Anfang/Ende einen richtig hübschen Anstieg den Petrisberg hoch. Start- und Endpunkt ist das Restaurant &quot;Jahreszeiten&quot; am Turm Luxemburg, in dem ich immer wieder gerne einkehre.</p>
<p>Viel Spaß!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday’s ride was also a “new kit day” ride.
I had installed the @wolf_tooth_comp RoadLink DM to improve shifting of my recently installed @rideshimano RD-RX800 and 11–40 XT cassette.
Mind you, shifting works fine with this combination alone but it’s not as smooth as I would’ve hoped. I’m not sure if the amount of B-screw tension I had to apply to make the derailleur clear the 40-tooth cog is a factor here.
Anyway, the RoadLink DM really helped. Shifting performance is now on the level of my old RD-R8000 and 11–30 cassette combination.</p>

			 <p>Went for my first longer ride after the holiday and the cold and it felt great to be on the bike again. It was also the first outing with the new 11–40 cassette and it made a huge difference going up steep and loose forest roads compared to the old 11-30 cassette.</p>

			 <p>This editorial cartoon drawn by <a href="https://twitter.com/CH_Cartoon">Bruce MacKinnon</a> and <a href="http://www.thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/editorial-cartoons/editorial-cartoon-sept-29-2018-245696/#.W69bSmHJT-o.twitter">published in The Chronicle Herald</a> popped up in my Twitter feed this morning and I'm alternating between amazement, speechlessness, sadness, and fear for the U.S.A.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/dce86cdf4d.jpg" alt="Bruce MacKinnon's editorial cartoon for Sept. 29, 2018. - Bruce MacKinnon, Copyright: The Chronicle Herald"> <em>Bruce MacKinnon's editorial cartoon for Sept. 29, 2018, Copyright: The Chronicle Herald</em></p>
<p>The cartoon shows the arms of a person pinning down the blindfolded Lady Justice on a bed, with a hand over her mouth, in reference to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford-releases-sworn-declarations-from-husband-and-three-friends/2018/09/26/2f5e8302-c173-11e8-90c9-23f963eea204_story.html">accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford</a> against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee. The cufflinks of the abuser have the GOP's elephant on them.</p>
<p>I think this is an amazing piece of political satire, absolute genius. I'm German, I live in Germany, I'm only indirectly affected by what happens over there but the proceedings of last week, which were hard to ignore even over here, had me speechless so many times.<br>
To me, it's inconceivable that the GOP props up a man for the highest judicial position in the country, who has had a number of credible accusations of sexual assault, and testimony of character leveled against him, that absolutely disqualifies him not just for the Supreme Court but for any position in the judicial system. And that doesn't even cover the frankly insane and disgraceful performance before the Judicial Committee which betrays a deep disdain for the rule of law, hatred towards women, and shows a complete lack of capacity for impartiality.</p>
<p>It's sad that U.S. politics is at a point where the Republicans, who have long been a danger to the U.S.A., are now willing to risk the last shred of independence of the Supreme Court to push through their agenda of hate, misogyny, homophobia, and shameless pursuit of power over other people, all of it driven by nothing but greed.</p>
<p>The fear that if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, the U.S. will deteriorate into an autocracy even faster, is very real and I sincerely hope that the people of the U.S. realise this and stand up before it is too late.</p>
<h3 id="sidenote">Side note:</h3>
<p>This morning I read about an interesting case the Supreme Court is going to decide very soon: <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gamble-v-united-states/">"Gamble vs. US"</a><br>
Some people on Twitter argued that the true reason the GOP and Trump want to push Kavanaugh into a SCOTUS seat, is so he can rule on the above case.<br>
At its core, the lawsuit is about a weapon possessions charge and whether a defendant can be tried for the same charge by both state and federal authorities (so called "double jeopardy"). <a href="https://www.democraticunderground.com/100211211624">Several people argue that</a> a decision to prevent state and federal authorities from prosecuting someone for the same crime, could mean that a federal pardon from Trump, might prevent state authorities from prosecuting a person and would thus minimise the pressure state prosecutors can put on defendants in cases linked to Trump.</p>

			 <p>Small change that will hopefully make a big difference in riding.
I replaced the 100 mm stem—that I had already flipped up—with a 80 mm stem to reduce the overall reach. I hope it’ll help because I’ve recently noticed myself moving back from the hoods on longer flat stretches.</p>

One of the things I love about metropolitan cities is the sheer choice of amazing food places: 1. tuna steak @thekegtoronto, 2. bao buns @momofukutoronto, 3. The Big Vic burger and fries at Victor Restaurant @legermainhotels, 4. lemon pie at Victor Restaurant, 5. Tuna Tango sushi burrito  @suandbu 106 John Street, 6. hot dog slider and pizza at Sightlines Restaurant at the Rogers Centre (the food there wasn’t particularly good but it was my first baseball game experience and that counts for something).</p>

			 <p>I continue to enjoy the images the iPhone 7’s sensor is capable of capturing in a) the right circumstances and b) when shooting RAW and editing to one’s liking.
I’ve been frustrated with the output of the iOS JPEG engine and the lack of dynamic range the images had, typically shooting with a Fujifilm X-Pro2 and some really good glass. For me, the ability to capture DNG on the iPhone has legitimised it as a capable camera again, beyond something for basic snapshots.</p>

			 <p>When writing about gear, I typically try to limit myself to solutions for problems I faced, or some New Shiny™ that really piqued my interest. This is an exception. It's an ode to my favourite lens.</p>
<p>Half a year after having started shooting with a Fujifilm X-E1 and the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM OIS kit lens, I was considering buying a lens with a wide aperture for greater creative freedom. I checked which focal length I used most often and at the time ~ 75% of the shots I kept were somewhere around 23 mm (~ 35 mm full-frame equivalent) leading me to buy the <a href="http://fujifilm-x.com/de/lenses/xf23mmf14-r/">Fujifilm XF23mmF1.4 R</a>.</p>
<p>I won't lose too many words about the overall quality of this lens. Many people have done so before me and most of them have a lot more experience with photography and gear than I do. The focal length is versatile, the build quality and the overall image quality are great. Placing the field of focus is easy, and considering the amount of glass that has to be moved, it focuses quickly enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-K2CCjSK/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/75b06aa1e8.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that I absolutely love about the 23/1.4, is the fact that it's so boring, so predictable, so utterly unspectacular. In other words, it's dependable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two characteristics that influence the dependability and predictability of the lens the most are sharpness and the way it makes out-of-focus areas look.</p>
<h3 id="sharpness">Sharpness</h3>
<p>Even wide open, the lens renders sharp pictures across ~ 70% of the frame from the center. More importantly, though, this doesn't change based on the subject distance. I can shoot close-ups at ƒ/1.4 and be sure that the center of the frame is going to be tack sharp while anything behind it ends up an unrecognisable blur. When shooting landscapes in waining light at the widest aperture, I know that the result is still going to be good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-kCgZ4kc/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/3f9b6ce91c.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<h3 id="renderingoftheoutoffocusareas">Rendering of the out-of-focus areas</h3>
<p>Many great lenses can also be capricious at times, where the way the out-of-focus areas are rendered can vary wildly depending on the subject distance and aperture and lead to less than desirable results sometimes, like overly busy looking backgrounds. The XF23mmF1.4 R delivers absolutely consistent results that take a lot of guesswork out of taking pictures. I choose my subject, the distance and angle, and pick the aperture I want.<br>
Furthermore, the progression from sharp to blurry moving from the in-focus subject to the background feels almost linear (depending on the composition). The same holds true for aperture changes from ƒ/1.4 to ƒ/8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-9FrSDM3/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/1dbdb7a73a.jpg" alt="Mika's front paws"></a></p>
<p>If I could improve one aspect about the 23/1.4, it would be the addition of weather sealing. As one of the older optics in Fujifilm's line-up, it's not sealed against the elements.<br>
Unfortunately the smaller, lighter, and weather-sealed XF23mmF2 R WR is no viable alternative. Its image quality is great but the rendering characteristics aren't nearly as predictable or dependable, making the lens less versatile.</p>
<p>Even so, the XF23mmF1.4 R is the lens I would take to a deserted island with me, the glass I would choose if I had to go with one lens for the rest of my days.</p>

			 <p>A month that started pretty meager in terms of photography but ended with a bang. At the end of January it was time for the annual company conference, which we spend it on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. This time I took a few days in Miami and Fort Lauderdale beforehand and visited the Everglades National Park.</p>
<p>A friend and I went there fairly early in the morning and rented two bicycles to take a 16-mile round course. It was great and I really want to do it again.</p>

The fact that parts of the press and the WHCA are admonishing Michelle Wolf for the speech is absolutely disgraceful.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I can't help but giggle whenever a company is lauded for reinventing the wheel in IT. Today's example:</p>
<p>Logitech just announced a new keyboard with a dial, customizable through their software. It looks nice and solid—as Logitech hardware usually does—and it works on macOS and Windows.</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qY-FmTQQhEk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p>I read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/31/16228168/logitech-craft-smart-keyboard-creative-dial-windows-mac-photoshop-mx-mouse">the article on The Verge</a> and watched the video. All I could think of was how much this reminded me of the Sony Jog Dial™ built into my first own laptop, a 14" Sony Vaio back in 2001.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/494560e969.jpg" alt="Sony Jog Dial on a Vaio laptop."><br>
<em>Image credit: <a href="http://itc.ua/articles/noutbuki_s_perednego_kraya_10197/">ITCua</a></em></p>
<p>It, too, was backed by drivers and a customization app. I loved this thing to death, having used it for everything from navigating the Start Menu, to controlling Winamp, to running system macros that took care of actions requiring a lot of tedious clicking.</p>
<p>So yes, if the software is sufficiently easy to use and flexible and if the integrations with third party apps work well, this new Logitech keyboard will undoubtedly be a good tool. But it's really nothing new.</p>

<p>Make no mistake:<br>
The sitting president of the United States of America doesn't condemn and thus approves of neo-Nazis. He implicitly agrees with their actions. The fact that he hasn't yet been impeached by the GOP, which controls both chambers of Congress, tells you that most of them approve of the actions of neo-Nazis, too.</p>

			 <p><h4 id="politikalsluxusstefanschulz"><a href="https://sozialtheoristen.de/2017/08/11/politik-als-luxus/">Politik als Luxus</a> — Stefan Schulz</h4>
<p>In den letzten zwei Tagen ist dieser Artikel immer wieder in meiner Twitter-Timeline aufgetaucht und ich habe ihn mittlerweile zweimal gelesen.</p>
<p>Der Autor diskutiert die vermeintliche Politikverdrossenheit der unter 40-jährigen vor dem Hintergrund der wirtschaftlichen, sozio-politischen, und medialen Gegebenheiten.</p>
<p>Ich finde mich in dem Artikel an vielen Stellen wieder, denn auf der einen Seite bin ich unzufrieden mit dem politischen Status Quo unseres Landes, insbesondere mit den immer stärker werdenden anti-sozialen Entwicklungen. Leider habe ich weder die Zeit mich neben meinem Beruf darum zu kümmern, noch wüsste ich, wo ich konkret damit beginnen soll, denn ich finde mich in keiner Partei wieder.</p>
<hr>
<p>Die <strong>CDU/CSU</strong> steht außer Frage, denn der braune Partner der CDU lässt selbst die mildesten progressiven Ansätze direkt im Keim ersticken.</p>
<p>Die <strong>SPD</strong> ist die CDU in schwarz-rot, gelenkt von verachtungswürdigen Menschen wie Sigmar Gabriel, der nachweislich lieber der Wirtschaft dient als deutschen Bürger*innen. Hierbei meine ich ganz konkret d<a href="http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-09/spd-stimmt-mehrheitlich-fuer-ceta-abkommen/komplettansicht">ie Abstimmung der SPD-Vollversammlung für CETA, die Gabriel durchgeboxt hat</a>. Ein undemokratischeres Handelsabkommen kann ich mir zwar vorstellen, aber CETA und TTIP kommen schon verdammt nah dran. Wirklich tragisch daran ist, dass ich <em>für</em> klar definierte und öffentlich verhandelte Freihandelsabkommen bin.</p>
<p>Die <strong>Grünen</strong> wollen so sehr mitregieren, das sie bei der bloßen Andeutung der Chance auf eine Möglichkeit des Ansatzes einer Koalition jegliche Prinzipien über Bord werfen. Ihnen fehlen sowohl die Themen als auch klare Positionen zu Umwelt, Datenschutz, und sozialer Gerechtigkeit.</p>
<p>Bei den Äußerungen von Vertretern der <strong>Linken</strong> läuft es mir eiskalt den Rücken runter. Diese Partei steckt voller Populisten und sie bewegt sich mittlerweile so weit links, dass sie wieder gut genug zu den Rechten passen, um demnächst mit dem &ldquo;progressiven&rdquo; Flügel der AfD zu fusionieren.</p>
<p>Ach ja, die <strong>AfD</strong>. Diese Partei ist in kürzester Zeit von einer <em>NPD light</em> für den besorgten Bürger (= fremdenfeindlich, anti-sozial) zu einer <em>NPD 2.0</em> mutiert, die genauso wenig etwas in Deutschland verloren hat, wie die NPD, REP, und alle sonstigen blödsinnigen Gruppierungen ewig Gestriger (ich schaue euch an, Reichsbürger).</p>
<hr>
<p>Wo soll ich mich also einsetzen? Wo soll ich im Herbst mein Kreuz setzen? Wie kann ich irgendeine Partei unterstützen, wenn diese nicht an Wahlversprechen gebunden ist?</p>
<p>Vor diesem Dilemma stehe ich und viele meiner Freunde und ich sehe derzeit einfach keine Lösung.</p></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Verge has a short article up on pilotless planes, a study about consumer acceptance of pilotless planes, and the economic effects: <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16107324/pilotless-planes-save-airlines-billions-passengers-unwilling-fly-ubs-report">Pilotless planes could save airlines billions, but passengers don’t want to fly in them yet</a></em></p>
<p>I thought about this a bit and I realised that I'd actually be willing and curious to be a passenger on a pilotless plane.</p>
<p>This passage, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UBS believes passengers could then see these savings passed down to them in the form of reduced fares, assuming there is no additional cost for flying pilotless and airlines don’t retain the benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/dmB5vD2t2gR8Y" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
<p>Really? Passing on savings to consumers. Really?</p>
<p>Let's ignore the development costs for this type of change that need to be recuperated; when was the last time you've seen publicly traded companies pass down savings to consumers?</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with making a profit and once this technology is mature enough to confidently and securely transport people, by all means, make a profit. I just think that we all shouldn't lie to ourselves and think that there will be a financial benefit for anyone but these companies.</p>
<p>Which, ultimately, shows us that the core message of this article can be found in the first part of the title:<br>
<em>"Pilotless planes could save airlines billions"</em></p>

<p>The below shot of the dove is just a nice example of the great dynamic range offered by Fujifilm's X-Trans sensors. In the original picture the sky and parts of the trees were blown out. Reducing the highlights in the internal RAW converter in the X-Pro2 brought them back nicely.</p>

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2017/04/24/eddycam-mm-camera.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-04-24 15:35:00 &#43;0100">Apr 24, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My favourite camera strap by a long shot is the <a href="http://www.eddycam.com/de/shop/35mm/Edition-35mm-Schwarz-Schwarz.html">Eddycam Edition "35mm" in all black</a>. It's comfortable, robust, and the design is understated. I bought it alongside my Fujifilm X-Pro2 last year and kept it on the camera since then.</p>
<p>As much as I like this strap, there are two downsides to carrying my camera with a strap attached to the eyelets on either side of the body:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using heavier lenses on the body, the camera becomes front-heavy, making it dangle uncomfortably when carried over the shoulder, around the neck, and diagonally across the body.</li>
<li>I can't switch to using a wrist strap in those rare situations when I want to and wrapping the neck strap around my wrist is impractical and doesn't give me the secure feeling a wrist strap does.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a bit of searching for a quick-release solution to attach my Eddycam to, I ended up with the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/anchor-links">Peak Design Anchor Links</a>. I have a couple Peak Design camera accessories and straps and their quick connectors are second to none. The system is a bit bulky which was my one small, but ultimately unfounded, concern about pairing the Anchor Links with the Eddycam 35mm strap: it might've ruined the clean looks of the X-Pro2 + black Eddycam strap combination.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/f30e2e4048.jpg" alt="X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 01"></p>
<p>The big benefit of using a quick connector system like the Peak Design Anchor Links, is having a new option to carry my camera when attaching larger lenses like the <a href="http://fujifilm-x.com/de/lenses/xf16-55mmf28-r-lm-wr/">XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR</a> zoom, or the <a href="http://fujifilm-x.com/en/lenses/xf90mmf2-r-lm-wr/">XF90mmF2 R LM WR</a>. If I'm going to be using either of those lenses for a significant amount of time, I always attach the additional <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/accessories/camera_cases/#handgrip">hand grip MHG-XPRO2</a> to my camera, which has a little gap on the right side of the base that is perfect for attaching one of the Anchor Disks — I'm honestly not sure if this is an intentional feature of the hand grip, but it's undeniably useful :)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/260072880a.jpg" alt="X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 02"></p>
<p>With the strap attached to one of the eyelets on the camera and the small gap in the hand grip, the camera will now hang vertically on my side, making the combination more stable and comfortable to carry.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/0652626d4a.jpg" alt="X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 03"></p>
<p>I'm really happy with the result of this experiment and the increased versatility of this camera strap setup. The only thing missing now is an Eddycam wrist strap with an Anchor Link, as I don't find the Peak Design wrist strap very comfortable.</p>

			 <p>The Verge has a really funny article up, about Juicero, the <s>USD 700</s> USD 400 Wi-Fi-connected "juicer". The story behind and around this thing is utterly ridiculous and funny, especially once you realise that investors were convinced this is a good idea. Go ahead, read the article and watch the video; it's worth it for the laughs:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing">Turns out Juicero’s ludicrous Wi-Fi juicer is even more unnecessary than it sounds</a> — by Jacob Kastrenakes @ The Verge</em></p>
<p>Calling this device a juicer stretches the term almost past its breaking point:</p>
<ul>
<li>It merely squeezes pre-made juice packs into a glass.</li>
<li>It doesn't produce juice from fresh fruit or vegetables.</li>
<li>It's impractical because the small juice packs have to be replaced constantly and you have to put a glass beneath it by yourself.</li>
<li>It produces a huge amount of non-degradable waste, unlike, you know, an actual juicer.</li>
<li>It's not a stretch to assume a real juicer will give you fresher juice and store-bought organic juice is probably just as good.</li>
<li>It forces you to buy juice packs from the company behind the Juicero.</li>
<li>It's an <em>Internet of Things</em> device for no apparent reason other than to save you from having to push a button when you arrive in the kitchen (hoping that you remembered to put a glass beneath it beforehand).</li>
<li>It's probably easily compromised because I can't see a Silicon Valley startup caring about properly securing their IoT devices.</li>
<li>It, eventually, creates more problems than it solves and fails at being what it claims: a juicer.</li>
</ul>
<p>It boggles my mind that this thing was a) thought of as a good idea, b) developed beyond the basic conceptual stage, c) funded (!), and d) made into an actual product you can buy.</p>

<p>Fujifilm's practice of constantly evolving their cameras using firmware updates is something that gives me a really good feeling as a customer of theirs. With each major update my Fujifilm cameras have gained meaningful new features, felt snappier than before, saw gains in autofocus, continuous autofocus, or reduced electronic viewfinder blackout times.</p>

			 <p>May was a month full of snapshots and test shots.<br>
A friend of mine lent me his Fujifilm X-Pro2 for testing. I was going to go to the south-west of France for a few weeks and despite wanting a X-T2, I couldn't get the X-Pro2 out of my head. After a week of putting it through its paces, it turned out to be a love at second sight situation. I bought the camera shortly after and <a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-wz2rXKn/A">it's been my (daily) photography companion ever since</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-4b4LW6t/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/d2647628f1.jpg" alt="DSCF0041"></a></p>
<p>One of the things I really love about Fujifilm cameras are the film simulations — which is a fancy way of saying it has filters, just like Instagram :)<br>
The X-Pro2 added the black & white <em>Acros</em> film simulation and it was one of the things I was most curious about when I was testing the X-Pro2.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-trZhTd8/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/d644fa431d.jpg" alt="DSCF0087"></a></p>
<p>Mika, our smaller dog, was a very patient test subject, at least when she was comfortably lying on the couch (below) or in the bean bag chair (above).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-HkmNqzX/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/b506a34dfc.jpg" alt="DSCF0119 (Acros-G)"></a></p>
<p>The way Acros handles shadows and noisier sections of an image really is something. Of course, I did shoot a couple of pictures in colour, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-JNT6DZh/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/8644b7faf1.jpg" alt="DSCF0198 (Velvia, Schatten +1)"></a></p>

<p>The photo above is another one of those shots that just hammers home why the XF23mmF1.4 R is my favourite lens. It makes taking pictures like this effortless and fun.</p>

			 <p>If you like the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/">Unbreakable</a> as much as I do, listening to Jason Snell and team discuss it, is going to make you want to watch it again.</p>
<p>Unbreakable is one of those lesser known gems and one of the best superhero movies of the last twenty years. Unlike most action-heavy films, it is well written and directed and it aged equally well.</p>
<p>One of the things that weirded me out to no end when I saw the movie for the first time, was that I didn't notice the soundtrack (composed by James Newton Howard).<br>
Of course there is a soundtrack but it is so subtle and unobtrusive, woven into the movie so perfectly, I only became aware of the music a couple of times. This is a major factor why this movie will still put me on edge, even though I must've watched it at least ten times.</p>

			 <p>Turns Out™, I'm not putting up photo posts often enough. It's March 2017 and I'm finally showing pictures I took about a year ago.</p>

<p>Yellow tulips in front of a window. The way the afternoon light shone through the petals caught my eye.</p>

<p>This was a test shot with a new wide-angle lens I had bought, checking it for distortions. Goes to show that sometimes the most mundane things can look really nice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-03/i-9FrSDM3/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/f151aa668c.jpg" alt="Mika's front paws"></a></p>
<p>Taking a short break on a walk with my dogs, the little dog finally got comfortable on the wooden lounger we sat down on. Mika is a sweet dog and her little paws always remind me more of a cat's than a dog's. This isn't helped by the fact that she tends to behave like a cat sometimes. She's a rescue that a family member adopted when she was already about four years old and I always suspected that she grew up with cats.</p>

			 <p>Der folgende Tweet erschien gestern in meiner Zeitleiste und ich musste herzlich lachen.</p>
<p>Eines der von den anti-demokratischen, teilvernebelten Vollpfosten der <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsb%C3%BCrgerbewegung">Reichsbürgerbewegung</a> ist ja, <a href="https://www.vice.com/de/article/deutschland-hat-also-keinen-friedensvertrag-brd-gmbh-reichsbuerger-110">dass die Bundesrepublik Deutschland gar kein Staat sei, sondern eine GmbH</a>, usw., usw.</p>
<p>Nun, Thosten Meier (<a href="https://twitter.com/kaputte">@kaputte</a>) hatte dazu auf Twitter eine ganz tolle Antwort:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="de" dir="ltr">An die <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Reichsb%C3%BCrger?src=hash">#Reichsbürger</a> die nichts mit der <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BRD?src=hash">#BRD</a> GmbH zu tun haben wollen:<br>Bitte verlassen Sie unverzüglich das Firmengelände</p>&mdash; Thorsten Meier (@kaputte) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaputte/status/838132335736459264">March 4, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>P.S.:<br>
Ich habe ein großes Problem mit so verdammt blöden Behauptungen wie &quot;die BRD ist eine GmbH&quot;. Hinter solch hirnverbrannter Propaganda, die nur dazu dient rechtsextreme und demokratiefeindliche Argumentationen in der öffentlichen Diskussion salonfähig zu machen, gehen grundsätzlich die Missstände unter, die tatsächlich Beachtung finden müssten.<br>
Im Fall der &quot;BRD GmbH&quot; ist es meiner Meinung nach der Umstand, dass in Deutschland der Lobbyismus inzwischen fast U.S.-amerikanische Ausmaße angenommen hat und dadurch der Einfluss von Unternehmen und wohlhabenden Personen auf die Politik, <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/themen/lobbyismus-und-die-folgen">in einem für das Volk und den Staat gefährliche Maß</a>, zunehmend ausartet.</p>

			 <p>In yesterday's core segment of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver dug into the talking points Republicans have for discussing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Let me repeat that: he didn't dig into the actual bill to repeal it, or the bill that would replace the ACA, but the talking points Republicans use to rile up support for the repeal.</p>
<p>As usual, it's an interesting piece that shows just how much Republicans hate the poor, the sick, and those in need.</p>
<p>Watch it and make up your own mind about whether it's a good idea to repeal it.</p>

			 <p>My admiration of Samantha Bee and her team behind Full Frontal is no secret.</p>
<p>This recent video highlights the hypocrisy by politicians, large parts of the infotainment industry, and political pundits that is trying to pit the needs of veterans of the U.S. military against helping refugees from Syria and other war-torn places around the globe.</p>
<p>It also shows the side of the U.S.A. that reminds me why it was called the land of the free and it fills me with hope.</p>
<p>This is the side of America, that the U.S. people must keep from being destroyed by the white supremacists, racists, anti-semites, islamophobes, and criminals that Trump—<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-lost-the-popular-vote-by-2-8-million-most-republicans-are-convinced-he-won-b0d8d3c0a0b0#.a7y2b7i01">who lost the popular vote</a>—is drawing into the White House out of the swamps he vowed to drain, and the dark crevices in hell that even the devil won't look into.</p>

			 <p>Microsoft has really come into its own as a computer manufacturer in recent years — the Surface Studio is another example of that. When it was announced in late October, I thought it was a brilliant idea. It's such an interesting and well executed device, I'm kind of sad that I have absolutely no use for one.</p>
<p>For the niche Microsoft is trying to capture with this flagship device, it will likely be a welcome alternative to using a PC or Mac with a Wacom pen display or tablet.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/17/13663112/microsoft-surface-studio-review">review by the Tom Warren over on The Verge</a> provides an in-depth look at the device, the usage modes, and its shortcomings and is well worth watching.</p>

			 <p>Today my Apple Watch recommended I increase my daily calorie goal. Again. Ugh.</p>
<p>I've reached my activity goals every day for the past 43 days and it's starting to show. A big part of what keeps me motivated each day, is Activity Sharing: a feature that allows me to privately, securely, and easily share my daily progress with friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>It is really cool that a friend of mine from Australia and I can engage in some healthy—no pun intended—competition and help each other stay on track.</p>
<p>Along with the increased activity, I started slowly changing my diet. So far, I've simply reduced the amount of sweets I eat and substituted some of the carbs I usually eat with slightly fattier foods.</p>
<p>Besides being generally fitter and more alert, I find that all the exercise really helps with my mood and motivation throughout the day.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch has been great as a fitness tracker for me in the past six months but Activity Sharing improved on this a lot.</p>
<p>Now I need to get up and get moving because the dog just woke up; she wants to go for a walk and I have a couple hundred calories to burn before I fill that ring today.</p>

			 <p>I'm inching closer to September 2016 with my snapshot posts. Quick as a snail.</p>

<p>Walking the dogs always gives you the nicest opportunities to test out camera features like continuous focus. These two were running full speed at me and the camera tracked Bijou (the big one) very well considering I was shooting in dim light at ƒ/2 with the <a href="http://fujifilm-x.com/en/lenses/xf56mmf12-r/">XF56mmF1.2 R</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-02/i-QhnpLj5/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/0ce1866950.jpg" alt="Weidenkätzchen im Wind"></a></p>
<p>Cold weather? <em>Check</em><br>
Dim light at dusk? <em>Check</em><br>
Shallow depth of field? <em>Check</em><br>
I do enjoy taking photos like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-02/i-vWCjDtj/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/a76e2997a7.jpg" alt="DSCF5561"></a></p>
<p>Favourite pastime for the dogs: sleeping. They just look too darn cute when they're exhausted from a long walk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-02/i-KQgW2L2/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/409892f241.jpg" alt="Abends am Uni-Teich 02"></a></p>
<p>I saw this scene, rushed home with the dog, grabbed my tripod and camera, and ran back hoping the moon hadn't wandered too to get this shot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-02/i-H7nj9QX/A"><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/721fa736cf.jpg" alt="Mika im Sitzsack"></a></p>
<p>This is another one of those pictures that perfectly captures Mika's character. She's lying in the bean bag chair, completely relaxed, looking like she owns it.<br>
Considering that she's a rescue from Romania where she lived off trash and meat scraps for a long time, she's become quite the diva.</p>

<p>If you just watched this and thought it kinda reminded you of the video for Fatboy Slim's "Weapon of Choice" with Christopher Walken, that's not a coincidence because the director, Spike Jonze, was responsible for that one, too. <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/spike-jonze-perfume-ad-kenzo-world/">Slashfilm has an article with more information about the video</a> and, of course, people on the internet made several video comparisons of this ad and the Weapon of Choice video.

<p>I stumbled across this article while drinking my morning coffee and smiled all the way through.</p>
<p>Back in 2001 I was working part-time at an electronics retailer in Mainz, Germany besides school. At that time, digital cameras were found in the computer department and not with film cameras.</p>
<p>The F707 was a small marvel. It looked utterly alien for a camera even back then and boasted a few incredible features like proper infrared night vision that could either work on its own or a a focussing aid in almost complete darkness. It also had a <em>LASER</em> focussing system which was insanely cool and worked quite well.</p>
<p>Back then, Sony reclaimed goods if they weren't sold in stores after a while and before that happened, they were usually offered to store employees at a heavy discount. I snagged the one remaining F707 we had in the store, making this not only my first digital camera but my first own camera, period.</p>
<p>It holds a special place in my heart and the fact that it still works is just bonus.</p>

			 <p>I've watched Batman v Superman a couples of times now. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It has some very serious problems with representing women that were hard to look past most of the time and made me cringe. Walking out of the cinema on premiere weekend—fittingly, the Metropolis in Frankfurt—discussing the movie with my sister, I felt that apart from aforementioned issue, something was off with the movie, that it felt like a bunch of snapshots of events put together, making it hard to find any sort of golden thread.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I stumbled across this interesting video review with an overly sensationalistic title, capturing this particular issue pretty well:</p>

<p>All in all, it was an entertaining film and the extended edition is a bit better, in my opinion. The shortest and most accurate criticism came from the inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/darth/">@darth</a> on Twitter tonight:</p>



<p>Yes, Wonder Woman was severely underrepresented in the movie but what saved it for me was the feeling that in the few moments Wonder Woman was on screen, the writers, the director, and most importantly Gal Gadot managed to capture the core of the character. She's educated, smart, more experienced and more level-headed than Batman or Superman, strong, a formidable fighter, and a true warrior.</p>
<p>There was a scene in the fight against Doomsday, where she was thrown back by a mighty blow of the creature but catching herself, the look on her face showed determination and the joy of battle.</p>
<p>It reminded me of one of my favourite moments in DC's New 52 run when Superman and Wonder Woman became a couple. Batman was explaining his misgivings about their relationship to Superman by showing Supes a number of boxes stored in a secure corner of the Bat Cave. Each of these boxes contained countermeasures for each member of the Justice League, should they ever go rogue. The only one he didn't have a countermeasure for, was Wonder Woman. He deemed her so powerful that the only way to stop her, if turned evil, would be Superman.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the 2017 Wonder Woman and the Justice League movies capture all facets of the character; the grace, the wisdom, the unshakeable belief in doing the right thing, the knowledge that sacrifices are sometimes necessary in battle, and not just the looks and fighting skills. The ComicCon trailer does look promising:</p>

			 <p>After one visit to the <a href="http://www.tierheimtrier.de">local animal shelter</a> and three walks supervised by a dog trainer, Bijou moved in with us one year ago today.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/5187461eca.jpg" alt="Bijou, the first time we saw her in the animal shelter in Trier"> <em>Bijou, the first time we met her at the animal shelter in Trier</em></p>
<p>The shelter didn't have much information about her and we were only able to piece together a little more: She supposedly was about seven years old when we met her, is a mix between a Border Collie and a German Wirehaired Pointer, has lived not too far from Trier with a woman for five years, who adopted her out of a French animal shelter when Bijou was not even two years old. When the woman died unexpectedly and no one in her family would take Bijou in, she ended up in the animal shelter in Trier.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/a43527130d.jpg" alt="Bijou, the day she moved in with us, completely exhausted"> <em>The day she moved in with us, completely exhausted</em></p>
<p>The first few months after the adoption haven't been without issues, what with the surprise that the spayed dog we picked up going into heat about a week after she moved in with us, the discovery that the reason for some of her crooked claws is a <a href="http://www.vetbook.org/wiki/dog/index.php?title=Lupoid_onychodystrophy">genetic disorder</a> which thankfully hasn't resurfaced again, so far, and the surgery she had to go through in December 2015 to have her spleen removed because her vet discovered growing masses in it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/96260c03eb.jpg" alt="Bijou in a children's dinosaur onesie after her spleen removal surgery"> <em>Bijou after her spleen removal surgery, in a children's dinosaur onesie that we got her in lieu of an Elizabethan collar</em></p>
<p>The good thing is that Bijou didn't mind the frequent visits to the vet and quickly became the staff favourite at the clinic because she was so incredibly relaxed, never showing even the smallest signs of aggression during the examinations.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/c033fd6ba4.jpg" alt="Relaxing after a long day at the beach in the Netherlands"> <em>Relaxing after a long day at the beach in the Netherlands</em></p>
<p>The way she behaved towards the staff of the veterinary clinic was the first indicator that had found an incredible dog. She also has little to no hunting instinct which, on a few occasions, made for fun encounters with cats, foxes, deer, horses, and cows. Especially deer were surprised not to be chased or barked at, to the point of coming closer to us during a few walks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, she's a walking food vacuum and loves to try anything and everything as long as it smells tasty. I do consider this a positive, though, because we can get her to do all sorts of things for food.</p>

<p><em>First attempt at teaching Bijou a patience trick</em>
<p>I grew up around dogs and have met all sorts. I can say without a doubt that I&rsquo;ve never met a dog as relaxed as Bijou. She seems to be utterly and completely unflappable. We were particularly happy to see that all she needs to accept a new environment or situation, is seeing me and my girlfriend being at ease.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a bit protective towards us when it comes to other dogs and we found out that she seemingly never learned to play the way dogs usually do. She never reacts aggressively towards playful dogs, though, and she is quick to accept anyone that we consider a part of the pack. Like Mika, a dog from a family member that we had the pleasure of caring for for a few months while they were recuperating from a knee injury.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/b4432e9f45.jpg" alt="Bijou, Mika, and I napping in the bean bag chair"> <em>Bijou, Mika, and I napping in the bean bag chair</em></p>
<p>One thing Bijou never understood, though, is Mika&rsquo;s obsession with digging in the ground hunting rodents:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/2fcd916424.jpg" alt=""Mika's digging again, isn't she?""><br>
<img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/feaeed07a7.jpg" alt=""Yup. As if you ever catch anything.""><br>
<img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/398da8de50.jpg" alt=""Can we go please, my butt is getting cold.""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an eventful first year with her with a few downs and many, many ups. She has enriched our lives immensely in innumerable ways and we hope that she will spend many more years as part of our family.</p>

			 <p>I have to say that up until now I wasn't particularly looking forward to new Star Trek movie. Even though I loved the previous two films, <a href="https://youtu.be/XRVD32rnzOw?list=PLVjwdZylAT2n95xY_gEMDw5_XAklnN9tE">the first trailer</a> for this next chapter of the Star Trek saga looked too much like <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> and not enough like <em>Star Trek</em>.</p>
<p>I realise that the new movies are more heavily focussed on action and entertainment—and I'm all for that—but it'd be sad to see the legacy of what made Star Trek such an amazing universe be ignored to create another action flick.</p>
<p>This second trailer gives me hope because we see a few glimpses of the character development the movie might bring with it, some manner of violent commentary about the Federation's expansion, and a plot that appears less straight-forward than the first trailer made it seem.</p>
<p>Take a look for yourself.</p>

<p>This is a great review of the Fujifilm X-Pro2. It's especially good for people who want to know what's with the fuss about Fujifilm cameras.</p>
<p>I've been shooting with Fujifilm cameras for two over two years now and it's still interesting to hear from people passionate about photography, discover Fujifilm cameras for the first time, getting used to the "retro" way of adjusting the core settings, being  subjected to the way Fujifilm cameras and lenses render colours and light, and realising that the JPEGs that come out of the cameras pretty damn good.</p>
<p>Head over to her website to <a href="http://photographyconcentrate.com/fujifilm-x-pro-2-field-test-costa-rica/">read the written review and check out the sample photos</a> she posted.</p>

			 <p>I had an interesting experience on the weekend.<br>
My girlfriend and I finally got around to watching Ant-Man together and we decided to give it a try in 3D.</p>
<p>Usually we're not fans of 3D, not even if it's as well made as with the Hobbit movies. There are several issues: we both wear spectacles and the 3D glasses they hand out in the cinema never fit well, and it costs an arm and a leg for something that you don't really need.</p>
<p>I watched the first Hobbit movie in both in 2D and 3D. While 3D was a nice gimmick, it didn't make me like the movie more. That's pretty much how I felt about any other movie shown in 3D.</p>
<p>Until watching the 3D version of Ant-Man… which didn't suck.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because we had the choice to watch it in 2D (unlike in the cinema, where movies are often only shown in 3D for the first few weeks),<br>
maybe it was because the glasses LG has are actually more comfortable,<br>
maybe it was the fact that we were sitting in a space controlled by us without a bunch of strangers.</p>
<p>It was an enjoyable experience and we'll be attempting to confirm our hypothesis that 3D movies are best watched at home over the next few months.</p>

			 <p>I've been looking for a fitness tracker for a while now. Ever since we got our dog back in August 2015 I've been seeing improvements to my fitness, because—DUH!—the little beast has to be taken for walks every day.<br>
I wanted to build on these small improvements and decided to begin running more, again, go to the gym more, and try out high-intensity bodyweight training.</p>
<p>In pursuing these activities, I quickly realised that the iPhone as my tool of choice for tracking steps, storeys climbed, heart rate, and calories burned would not be sufficient. One might think that the Apple Watch would've been a natural fit for me—seeing as I'm pretty comfortable in Apple's ecosystem—but I saw too many things wrong with it to be a good fitness tracker and watch replacement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of actual waterproofing</li>
<li>Short battery life of only about a day</li>
<li>No continuous heart rate tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>The fitness tracker I would buy had to be better than the Apple Watch in all those areas and make it easy for me to use the data outside of the manufacturer's ecosystem (which immediately ruled out products from FitBit who think it's ok to lock a user into a platform with the user's own data).</p>
<p>I ended up with the Garmin vivosmart HR, a favourite of <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2015/11/garmins-vivosmart-hr-reviewed-dont-buy-a-fitbit-before-considering-this-band/">Ars Technica UK</a> and <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-fitness-tracker/">The Wirecutter</a> and from the looks of it the current best-of-breed fitness tracker on the market. It ticked all the boxes for me, with a waterproof body specified for swimming, 5-day battery life, and continous heart rate tracking. Garmin's platform, albeit not too pretty, also allows for downloading of all running data and it integrates with Apple Health on my iPhone.</p>
<p>It should've been the perfect device for me but intensively using it for a week taught me a few things about myself and my actual needs in a fitness tracking device which, in turn, brought the Apple Watch back into the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproofing</strong><br>
I don't go swimming with it (I hate swimming), so as long as it can withstand my sweat and rain (I love running in the rain), that's enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Continous heart rate tracking</strong><br>
This sounds like a useful feature and I'm sure it has its merits but <em>continuous</em> doesn't actually mean <em>continous</em> for the Garmin (or any other product as I found out later) as it only takes snapshots of your heart rate in regular intervals and activates continous tracking only when it detects significant changes for a certain period of time. That's still quite useful, especially when you're into sleep tracking but I'm not, which brings me to…</p>
<p><strong>Battery life</strong><br>
I tried wearing the vivosmart HR during the night but found it too uncomfortable. There's a hump on the underside of the device that houses the optical heart rate sensor and—at least for me—it became a slight nuissance when sleeping. So, just like with my wrist watches, I took it off at night. And if I take it off at night, I might as well put it on a charger.</p>
<p>Then there's the fact that wearing a fitness tracker and a wrist watch at the same time felt stupid. With the exception of a short period in my life, I've always worn a mechanical or automatic wrist watch and it became apparent that the three issues that ascribed to the Apple Watch were actually non-issues.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks and my beloved <a href="http://traserh3watches.de/uhren/details/url/p6508-code-blue.html">Traser P6508 Code Blue</a> met its untimely and watery demise during a business trip. It was my favourite watch by a long shot because it was the perfect, lightweight no-frills watch that was easy to read in any light condition.<br>
I'll definitely get another Traser watch at some point and I own another really good wrist watch but for now I'll stick with the Apple Watch and see if it's as good a fit as I expect it to be.</p>
<p>This experience and my first few days with the Apple Watch have made me appreciate the compromises Apple has made with the watch in terms of waterproofing, battery life, feature set, and build quality. They've built a smart watch that will satify 90% of all potential user once economies of scale and experience curve effects bring the price down a bit for the lower end models.</p>

			 <p>Brian Jones, a scientist whose photography work I admire, has written an <a href="http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2016/02/the-leica-experiment/">article about his recent experiences using Leica cameras</a> again.</p>
<p>It's a good read that paints a picture of a brand that is letting their well-earned reputation as one of the top manufacturers for photographic tools slip away due to overconfidence and scant regard for their customers.<br>
This is best examplified by the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is, when it came time for the Monochrom to be serviced, I’ve not been able to get it back within anything close to a reasonable amount of time.  The Leica Monochrom camera has been undergoing service with Leica for literally six months now.  Say that with me… six months… SIX MONTHS!  Imagine you acquired or invested a substantial amount of money in a product that was supposed to return either 1) satisfaction from use or 2) return on investment as a tool by not only paying for itself, but also earning you income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who has developed a serious interest in photography over the last two years, Leica cameras and optics fascinate me. The reputation the brand has and the undeniably great optics that are out there, really have me itching to buy a one of their camera and a lens or two.<br>
Unfortunately reports like this—and I've been told similar things by other photographers—make me doubt that I will ever purchase a rangefinder camera of theirs.</p>

			 <p>I like Chucks. I used to love them but over the past two years I got fed-up with the quality and pricing of these shoes.</p>
<p>To my knowledge I haven't changed anything about the way I wear them, I didn't gain weight, and I still rarely wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row; but whereas before I knew that a pair of Chucks would last me about 1.5 years, I've had pairs (low top and high top) that only held up a mere six months before they fell apart.<br>
Add to that the fact that a pair of high top Chucks sells for a ridiculous € 75.– in German retail stores (<a href="http://www.mangochutney.me/201347the-price-of-chucks/">I wrote about this in detail two years ago</a>) while genuine high tops can be had for ~ € 16.– in Beijing (as I was able to see first-hand during a recent trip to China).</p>
<p>These experiences have changed my attitude towards the brand and the product for the worse and caused me to actively look for more durable, comfortable, stylish, and less overpriced alternatives (… to add to my evoked set). There are a couple of sneaker companies out there that make really nice, high-quality sneakers and shoes (Pointer, Boxfresh, Nike, etc.) and over the past two years, I've bought shoes from all of them.</p>
<p>About a week ago Converse/Nike introduced the first major update to this product line in nearly a century, resulting in the <a href="http://www.converse.com/s/converse/landing-chuckII">Converse Chuck Taylor All Star II</a>.  I'm not a sneaker fan, so the initial news/hype about the new version completely passed me by and I only got wind of it when I walked past a sneaker shop in Bonn.</p>
<p>A quick trip to the Converse website revealed the key features: a removable, well-cushioned Lunarlon sockliner (pretty comfortable Nike technology, if you ask me), a padded non-slip tongue that is held in place by two elastic bands, perforated micro suede lining, and Tencel® canvas on the outside, which, from experience, is more durable than cotton and regulates moisture more effectively.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble remembering if there was every time when where there wasn't at least one pair of Chucks in my shoe rack. I always liked that you can combine them with pretty much anything, that they don't look to extravagant and they're  timeless shoes at this point. For this reason I decided to give the new version a chance.</p>
<p>My initial impressions after wearing them in a shop in Trier are that the Lunarlon sockliner has the potential to be<em>a lot</em> more comfortable than the footbed of the old version, the canvas feels nice, and the overall workmanship seems to have seen significant improvements, too.<br>
While I'm not sold on the perforated suede and the padded tongue and ankles, the shoes felt so good on my feet that I found myself standing outside the shop 15 minutes later with a box containing vivid blue high top Chucks in my hands:</p>
<p>Time and wear will tell whether the overall quality and durability have been improved enough during the redesign, so I'll have an easier time convincing myself that paying € 80.– for a pair of Chucks isn't completely bonkers. Maybe I will even start keeping more than one pair in my shoe rack once again.</p>

<p>When the TMO team was in Breckenridge, CO last week for a writer's camp, I wrote the entire Particle Debris column, published on June 26, on the MacBook. That article was over 1,200 words, and I found the keyboard to be natural and precise. I now prefer it over any keyboard I have ever used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm in the market for a new machine and when Apple announced the new MacBook in March, the new keyboard drew my interest. While I don't like typing on a touchscreen very much, I have no problems with flat but good keyboards. When I finally had the opportunity to try the keyboard, a few days after the MacBook was available in stores, it took me about 20 minutes of typing to realise that I wanted this keyboard in my Mac, yesterday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, Apple seems to be using the new MacBook as a testbed not only for the concept of an ultra light laptop with just one port but also for this particular type of keyboard. Therefore, while a bit disappointing, it's not surprising that Apple didn't add the new keyboard to the MacBook Pro with Retina Display at the same time.</p>
<p>I hope that Apple will soon equip the rest of its line-up with this new type of keyboard.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just read about this on <a href="http://www.heise.de/mac-and-i/meldung/Werbeblocker-fuer-iOS-Safari-kuenftig-moeglich-2687525.html">heise.de</a>. Apple is going to allow <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH9-SW8">content-blocking extensions</a> in mobile Safari. Android has had this for a while and I was wondering how long it would take Apple to add/allow this kind of technology in iOS. There are many interesting connections to be made here:</p>
<p>One is Apple making clear that iOS can be a viable work platform and Apple is allowing users to remove unwanted distractions. This isn't something only consumers will be interested in but also corporations that deploy iOS devices, when factoring in the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7026282">potential bandwidth savings when using adblockers on mobile devices</a>. I think it makes a lot of sense in light of Apple's recently established cooperation with IBM and it might convince even more companies to deploy iOS devices (especially because these content-blocking extensions don't have to be limited to ads).</p>
<p>I would also say that Apple sees the potential to improve users' browsing experience and privacy on iOS devices and it says something about Apple's regard, or lack thereof, for the state of advertisments on websites today.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">allowing ads</a> in iOS 9's new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/#apps">News app</a> sends a mixed message to content publishers. I'm sure more than one media and ad agency executive will interpret this as, "If you want your readers to see ads and make money off of them, you should really take a look at our News app." or depending on your mindset even, "That's a nice ad business you have there. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it."</p>
<p>From my perspective as a consumer, I don't have much against what Apple is doing here, especially given Apple's history of trying—with an emphasis on <em>trying</em>—to improve ads on mobile devices with their <a href="http://advertising.apple.com">iAds</a> product. The few times I saw iAds in apps and on sites, I found them a lot less annoying than everything else that is out there.<br>
Of course, this will only hold true, if Apple not only mandates design standards for content in the upcoming News app but also for the way ads are presented to a reader.</p>

			 <p>I've known <em>about</em> <a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity</a> since the crowdfunding campaign started. The first time I actually <em>played</em> it was in 2014, during an evening of pizza, beer, and wine with colleagues/friends in Toronto prior to a company conference (where we played some more).</p>
<p>It's one of the funniest and tummy-ache inducing games I know of and I can't wait for the opportunity to play it again.</p>
<p>A friend told me that there's a 'Cards Against Humanity' episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F80C7D2DC8D9B6C">Tabletop</a> — a show hosted by Wil Wheaton, where he and various guests play various tabletop games. I watched it a few days ago and it's glorious.</p>
<p>If you want to get a sense of the game and see just what a filthy mouth old Ensign Crusher has, I encourage your to watch the video below :)</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> is a very good text editor by Bare Bones Software. It's—as the developers call it—the "little brother" to their flagship product <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>.<br>
It has always been more than sufficient for any of my HTML/CSS coding needs and I'm very grateful to Bare Bones Software for making this product free.</p>
<p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://ghost.org">ghost.org</a> and in order to make it look as I want it to, I sometimes have to edit the themes I use slightly. Since I'm mucking around in the code of the theme, whenever the original theme author makes a siginificant change/improvement to it, I have to manually re-add my modifications to the code.</p>
<p>This was usually a very tiresome job, because I kept going through each file (like the styles.css) line-by-line, looking for comments I made.<br>
Today I found an easier way to compare two versions of a file in TextWrangler:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the old and the new version of a file with TextWrangler.</li>
<li>Highlight both files in Textwrangler's sidebar.</li>
<li>Right-click, and select 'Compare'.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will open both files in windows next to each other and another window at the bottom of the screen, highlighting the differences between both.</p>

			 <p>… having to work with an old HDD-equipped MacBook Pro (MB133LL/A) again, while my current workhorse, a late-2013 13" MacBook Pro with Retina Display (ME865LL/A), was getting its display unit replaced.</p>
<p>I've had really bad luck with my Macs over the years, which is why I resorted to always having a backup machine at hand, should the main device need fail on me. I also back up my machine using Time Machine for my documents and <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> for bootable images on two separate external HDDs.</p>
<p>Too bad that the SSD that usually does its job in the old MacBook Pro—a Crucial M4 with 256 GB—decided to have a nice little firmware failure right at the same time, forcing me to put the original 250 GB HDD back into the old Mac.</p>
<p>Over the next two days I was forcefully reminded how incredibly great SSDs are. Not only did the process of restoring a 192 GB backup to the old Mac take an entire night but every task that would take my current Mac a couple of seconds to perform, caused my old MacBook Pro to crawl down to a slow.</p>
<p>I really don't want to have to work with a HDD-only PC ever again.</p>

			 <p>I love shooting with my Fujifilm cameras.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm neither a professional photographer nor an amateur with professional ambitions; I just enjoy it immensely. A big part of this are the cameras I use. I have a Fujifilm X-E1 and a X-T1 and it's a pleasure taking pictures with them.</p>
<p>I started out with the 18-55 mm (27–82.5 mm equiv.) kit zoom, which is really good. Shooting with the <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/">XF18-55</a>, I found out quickly that my preferred focal length was somewhere around 23 mm (35 mm equiv.), which caused me to shell out the money for the <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/">XF23mmF1.4 R</a> only a couple of months after I bought the X-E1 and it's the lens that I shoot with most of the time.</p>
<p>Recently, I became interested in experimenting with different focal lengths but didn't want to shell out the € 700 it costs to get a 15 mm equiv. lens on the Fujifilms, so I did a bit of research and quickly stumbled across a good number of old lenses that, while not as objectively great as many of Fujifilm's current offerings, would allow me to try and find out which focal lengths I really like using.</p>
<p>The X-series cameras use an APS-sized sensor and thus have a crop factor of about 1.5, meaning that I have to multiply the focal length of any lens I put on the camera with 1.5 to find out the 35 mm equivalent focal length.<br>
This isn't much of a matter when it comes to optics like those used for portraits, but it makes it really hard to get the super-wide-angle feel.</p>
<p>The solution was to use a focal length reducer, which can almost negate the crop factor of the sensor (meaning that a 20 mm lens won't be a 30 mm lens on an APS-sized sensor, but somewhere along the lines of a 21.6 mm focal length). I heard about this kind of piece of kit on Jonas Rask's site and the same article made me want to buy a Helios 44 lens. My last holiday took me to Hong Kong and one of the points on my agenda was to get the recently announced successor to the focal length reducer Jonas is using.</p>
<p>Now, I can't say a lot about the optical quality of the <a href="http://www.zyopticslens.com/lensturboII.html">Mitakon Lens Turbo II</a> and I suspect that it's still not as good as the original <a href="http://www.metabones.com/products/?c=speed-booster">Metabones Speed Booster</a> (the product it is based on) but you know what? <strong>It's a ton of fun!</strong> I haven't noticed any major shortcomings and the build quality is really good, much better than I'd have expected for the price.</p>
<p>The two lenses I use with the Lens Turbo II right now are a <a href="http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Helios-44">Helios 44M-4 2/58</a>, an old Soviet lens with a very particular bokeh—as seen in the photo at the top of this article—and a <a href="http://www.photozone.de/pentax/142-tokina-rmc-17mm-f35-review--lab-test-report">Tokina RMC II 17 mm ƒ/3.5</a> ultra wide-angle lens from Japan.</p>
<p>I haven't had a proper chance to really put the Tokina lens through its paces, but the Helios has already seen some good use. Below are some more pictures I recently took with it during a walk.</p>

			 <p>One of the nice things about using Apple devices, is that they receive major operating system updates for a longer period of time than smartphones and tablets running <em>Android</em> or <em>Windows Phone</em>. When buying an iPhone one can expect that it'll be served with the newest iOS for at least three or four years, as these charts by <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">Michael Degusta</a> and <a href="http://www.fidlee.com/android-support-vs-ios-support/">Fidlee</a> nicely illustrate. While the majority of consumers purchase and upgrade smartphones alongside two-year contracts with their cell phone provider (unlike tablets), it's good to know that an iPhone will be usable and up-to-date even after a two year contract has run its course.</p>
<p>Of course older iPhones aren't capable of making use of every new feature an iOS version jump provides and in many cases the phones will feel slower because the new OS requires more performance, as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/ios-8-on-the-iphone-4s-performance-isnt-the-only-problem/">this article by Andrew Cunningham at ars technica</a> shows. The iPhone 4 is not able to run iOS 8, and it's a safe bet that iOS 8 will be the last major update that the iPhone 4S is going to receive, pointing to a four year update lifecycle for the iPhone 4S as well. The iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c are basically the same phone and their CPUs are very similar to the ones in the previous iPhone generations, which means that they should receive updates for at least another two years if Apple doesn't change iOS in a way that requires more processing power than the 5 and 5c can deliver <em>without</em> becoming slow to the point of uselessness.</p>
<p>When the iPhone 5s was released and subsequently <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review/">reviewed by the incredibly smart folks at AnandTech</a>, we found out just how powerful the A7 processor with its 64-bit architecture really is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The A7 SoC is seriously impressive. Apple calls it a desktop-class SoC, but I'd rather refer to it as something capable of competing with the best Intel has to offer in this market. In many cases the A7's dual cores were competitive with Intel's recently announced Bay Trail SoC. Web browsing is ultimately where I noticed the A7's performance the most. As long as I was on a good internet connection, web pages just appeared after resolving DNS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the most interesting statement about the iPhone 5s's performance was made by Anand Lal Shimpi at the end of his review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The A7's GPU performance is also insanely good - more than enough for anything you could possibly throw at the iPhone 5s today, and fast enough to help keep this device feeling quick for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Apple's silicon teams have been doing for these past couple of years has really started to pay off. From a CPU and GPU standpoint, the 5s is probably the most futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while - the 5s is as good a starting point as any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air">John Gruber of Daring Fireball pointed out</a> that the iPad Air with its A7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> was faster than a 2010 MacBook Air in many benchmarks, pointing out the desktop-class performance that the iPad Air, the iPad mini with Retina Display, and the iPhone 5s offer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8559/iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus-preliminary-results">Early benchmarks of the newly announced iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus suggest</a> that Apple has once again managed to significantly improve the system performance of the A8 over the A7. However, these gains are similar to the past year-over-year CPU/GPU upgrades from Apple and not the kind of jump we saw when Apple moved from the 32-bit architecture of the A6 to the 64-bit architecture of the A7. While there are other significant internal differences between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, like the improved GPU and the NFC hardware for Pay, the 64-bit architecture, the fact that the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 have the same amount of RAM (1 GB), and the Touch ID technology make these phone very similar in most other respects.</p>
<p>I'm sure the next versions of iOS will introduce features that require a lot of processing power and it probably won't be long before we see apps and games that take full advantage of the CPU/GPU in 64-bit iOS devices.<br>
Still, I wonder if the shift to the 64-bit architecture might mean that in four years, when iOS 11 is released, the negative performance impact on the iPhone 5s will be comparatively lower than the impact iOS 8 presently has on the iPhone 4S, possibly making the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus the first iPhones with an even longer lifecycle than the previous generations, more in line with what we've come to expect from OS X updates, where a <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/06/03/os-x-yosemite-system-requirements-compatible-macs-list/">MacBook Pro from 2007 will still be able run OS X Yosemite</a> once it's released.</p>
<p>My 2008 pre-unibody MacBook Pro, that I keep around as a backup machine, is still perfectly up-to-date and usable. I really wouldn't mind being able to use an iPhone 6 for longer than the three years I've been using my iPhone 4S, even though I know that Apple will surely release something new and exciting next year, and the year after that, and the year after that …</p>

			 <p>The recent annoucement of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/">iPhone 6 (4.7") and the iPhone 6 Plus (5.5")</a> has existing and prospective Apple customers face the same reality that many Android smartphone users have been living with for few years already: <em>"HOT DIGGITY this phone is HUGE!"</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2046.html">The Joy of Tech</a>, one of my favourite webcomics, summarised the situation like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/21fe4a87ce.jpg" alt="The Joy of Tech, N° 2046"></p>
<p>My current iPhone is a 4S that I bought shortly after it was released three years ago. I skipped the 5 and 5s because I'm no fan of their design. While I'm still hesitant about the aluminium unibody construction of the 6 and 6 Plus—the steel chassis of the 4/4S is amazingly durable—it's time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Like so many other people I used one of the printable templates and some thick cardboard to make a decision between the 6 and the 6 Plus:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/5237f30e1e.jpg" alt="Google Nexus 7 (2013) vs. iPhone 6 Plus vs. iPhone 4S vs. iPhone 6"></p>
<p>To the far left there's my Nexus 7 (2013 edition), a 7" tablet.</p>
<p>Although I would've loved to have the greater battery life the iPhone 6 Plus offers and the 1920×1080 pixel resolution, I went for the iPhone 6 because in the end portability and pocketability matter more to me than the aforementioned advantages.</p>
<p>(The optical image stabilisation feature the 6 Plus has is great, but I carry an actual camera with me most of the time anyway, making it less relevant for me.)</p>

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/09/14/charlie-rose-interviews.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-09-14 18:06:00 &#43;0100">Sep 14, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tim Cook was interviewed by Charlie Rose a few days ago. I stumbled across the first part of the interview on <em><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/09/14/tim-cooks-charlie-rose-interview/">The Loop</a></em> earlier today and was surprised that I was able to watch it on Hulu in Germany.</p>
<p>A lot of what Tim Cook said was meant to promote Apple's products—which should surprise no one—but he was also very honest about Apple's goals and the things that make Apple the company that it is. Everything from Apple's product development philosophy, to their organisational structure, to the companies they regard as competition is in line with what everyone with a certain amount of knowledge about business and product development processes can observe.</p>
<p>I was left with three thoughts after this interview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Without any apparent hesitation Cook revealed much about the company's inner workings, it's hard to imagine getting this kind of candid information from any other C-level executive in the world. Frankly, I find it scary and impressive at the same time, because it demonstrates how sure Apple is that its corporate culture and its way of doing things is a unique competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Very few things that were said during the interview are news to people observing the company and the markets it engages in. Then why, with all this information out in the open, do so-called (or self-titled) analysts get so much wrong about Apple all the time? Why do players in the same markets constantly underestimate Apple and run their collective mouthes off? It really boggles the mind.</li>
<li>If I had to give an explanation as to why the company is as successful as it is and has been for a long time, it would be that in Apple's corporate culture the <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/smartwork/201004/vision-and-mission-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter">standard management buzzwords of 'vision' and 'mission'</a> are substituted with an actual sense of purpose to make great products.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're at all interested in understanding the company a bit better and getting a glimpse at what we as customers can expect in the years to come, you should follow the link to <em><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/09/14/tim-cooks-charlie-rose-interview/">The Loop</a></em> and watch the interview.</p>

I managed to get my hands on a copy of the 2002 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330829/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_156">Live on Broadway</a> show and had to stop playback multiple times while watching because my stomach hurt from laughing so hard.

			 <p>Apple released a new video advertising the capabilities of the iPhone. In line with Apple's style of promoting their products, they show how the device becomes what the user needs it to be, essentially becoming invisible. Here's the video:</p>

<p>When I watched it for the first time, I kept thinking how some of the apps the the accessories are the first steps towards turning the iPhone (which is already a <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/PADD">PADD</a>) into this:</p>

<p>Sure, there have been examples of hardware that adds one or two diagnostic tools to smartphones (see <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2014/mar/21/wello-heart-monitoring-iphone-case-in-pictures">here</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294044/scanadu-scout-the-handheld-medical-tricorder-shows-off-its-sleek-new">here</a>), not to mention the capabilities the right software adds, but I really can't wait to have the scanning features a concept like <a href="http://www.tricorderproject.org/tricorder-mark2.html">this</a> offers in the palm of my hand.</p>

			 <p>Ars Technica's Casey Johnston (one of my favourite authors on Ars Technica BTW), wrote a profile of Grado Labs, a company that everyone looking for the right pair of headphones has stumbled across at some point.</p>
<p>The article is nicely written and the accompanying video is well worth a watch. It shows a company focussed on quality and craftsmanship and above all, great sounding headphones. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/some-of-the-worlds-most-reknowned-headphones-built-in-a-brooklyn-townhouse/">Here's the link</a>.</p>
<p>Grado headphones aren't for everybody. Over the years I tried a few Grado phones and even though the sound signature wasn't my thing, the overall sound quality was pretty darn amazing.</p>
<p>Reading the linked article I realised once again how happy I am that I found <a href="http://www.westoneaudio.com/index.php/products/um-series/um-product-archive/um3x-rc.html">a pair of earphones</a> with a sound signature that makes me grin stupidly every time I put them into my ears.</p>

			 <p>Two great tastes that taste great together.</p>
<p>When I bought the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/gr0">Goruck GR0</a>, I wanted a sturdy daypack with enough space for a (1, 2, 3) day trip. I figured that I would use it to carry my Fujifilm X-E1 as well, but didn't give much thought to how the camera would rest in the backpack. My solution for carrying the X-E1 in the GR0 looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/487de9f81a.jpg" alt="LowePro wrapping cloth and string pouch"></p>
<p>A cushioned LowePro wrapping cloth and a simple cotton string pouch for the batteries, SD cards and a few other small items. This was bad for several reasons, but the most annoying one was my gear shifting positions in the backpack, forcing me to hunt for it when I wanted to retreive the camera or a fresh battery.</p>
<p>I started looking for a different solution and stumbled across great ideas <a href="http://jonadair.co.uk/post/14235335817/goruck-gr1-as-a-camera-bag-part-ii">like using the insert from a Bilingham Hadley Pro inside the GR0, as shown by Jon Adair</a>. Three things stopped me from going this route:</p>
<ol>
<li>The insert for Billingham Hadley Pro is quite expensive in Europe/Germany, costing around € 80.-</li>
<li>The insert would rest at the bottom of the pack, making efficient packing a bit harder when carrying more than the camera gear alone and potentially preventing quick access, too.</li>
<li>The Hadley Pro insert is of little use outside my GR0.</li>
</ol>
<p>I kept looking, trying out a few other camera pouches and inserts, like <a href="http://www.crumpler.eu/index.cfm?seite=photo&Banana-Bowl&productID=7863">Crumpler's Banana Bowl</a> and solutions by LowePro and less well-known companies. The issues I had with the Banana Bowl were pretty much paradigmatic for all the other products I found and/or tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were either to small with < 3.5 l or too big with > 5.5 l in volume and the outer measurements would've made it difficult to place them in the GR0.</li>
<li>The materials used weren't particularly desirable (like the neoprene on the Banana Bowls).</li>
<li>Very few had grips or attachment points for straps to use them as small camera bags outside the GR0.</li>
<li>There was no way to easily fix these camera inserts in place in the GR0.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had almost given up and started thinking about ways to modify a <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/gr2-field-pocket">Goruck GR2 Field Pocket</a> as a camera bag insert and even considered making my own padded Cordura 500 den, MOLLE webbing-equipped insert (I'm not completely inept with fabrics and a sewing machine).</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across a company called <em>f-stop</em> and their <a href="http://shop.fstopgear.com/us/products/icu/micro-icu/small-micro-icu.html">Micro Small ICU</a> (Internal Camera Unit). This company was entirely unknown to me but apparently they make really good gear, as <a href="http://www.packconfig.com/post/86601884738/review-f-stop-tilopa-bc-by-david-massey-tilopa">reviews like this one</a> show. Scouring their site for measurements and volumes (because the above insert was still a bit too big for my needs) I found the <strong><a href="http://shop.fstopgear.com/us/products/dakota/pouches/harney-pouch.html">Harney Pouch</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The dimensions (W × H × D) are 28 cm × 18 cm × 10 cm (11" × 7.1" × 3.9") with a volume of about 5 l.<br>
It was a perfect fit for the GR0 (11.5" × 17.5" × 5.5") or in fact any GR-series bag, because all of them are about 11.5" wide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/a25c7cba2b.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, front"></p>
<p>The Harney Pouch's outer fabric is 330 den Double Ripstop Nylon, it has a foam-cushioned and customisable main compartment, and two smaller and flatter compartments on the front (for less bulky accessories like batteries, memory cards, lens caps, and straps). It also comes with a light and comfortable shoulder strap, enabling use as a standalone bag. The bottom is reinforced and coated with a non-slip rubber.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/f29351b87f.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch with shoulder strap"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/15a041fc97.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, bottom"></p>
<p>The real kicker however is the backside of the pouch. Originally meant as an accessory to one of f-stops other carrying systems, it has straps on the back that are compatible with MOLLE webbing:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/c3da4c4b2b.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, back 1"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/4735f75610.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, back 2"></p>
<p>It fits the GR0's internal MOLLE webbing almost perfectly. There are only two things to observe when attaching it to the GR0:</p>
<ul>
<li>The middle vertical strap on the Harney Pouch can't be used (it's not really a MOLLE solution), and</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/33064d4afb.jpg" alt="Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 1"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/7a898d4f28.jpg" alt="Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 2"></p>
<ul>
<li>for the best possible fit, the vertical strap should be pulled through the topmost horizontal row of webbing on the Harney Pouch first and then through the topmost horizontal row of the GR0's internal webbing. Like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/c2ff022a23.jpg" alt="Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 3"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/a022afb6d9.jpg" alt="Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 4"></p>
<p>Attaching the Harney Pouch the regular way (by pulling the vertical straps through the GR0's topmost horizontal row first) will result in gap at the top of the pack, which can't really be utilised.<br>
The method described above places the Harney Pouch perfectly at the top of the Goruck, making it very easily accessible while not wasting any space.</p>
<p>Size-wise the Harney Pouch really hits a sweet spot for me. I'm a photography beginner and don't have much gear — I also don't plan to build up a massive arsenal of lenses and cameras. Here's what's inside the Harney Pouch:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/efb1c11430.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 1"></p>
<p>To the left there's the Fujifilm Fujinon XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS with the lens hood. The X-E1 rests in the middle, with the XF 23mm F1.4 R including the lens hood and an OP/TECH 'SLR Wrist Strap' attached. On the right there's the shoulder pad of my OP/TECH 'Utility Strap – Sling' (<a href="http://www.mangochutney.me/optech-camera-gear/">which I reviewed here</a>), the charger for the X-E1's batteries and the charger cable.<br>
In the frontmost compartment I store spare batteries and the memory cards and the middle compartment houses parts of the OP/TECH strap and some accessories for it as well as a spare lens cleaning cloth.</p>
<p>When I'm certain that I won't be using the camera during transit, I also store a rocket blower in the Harney Pouch.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/5a07bdf800.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 2"></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there's enough room in this camera bag to accomodate a mid-sized SLR with one additional lens or an even smaller mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (like the Sony Alpha 5000) with two additional lenses and some accessories.</p>
<p>When attached to the GR0, it effectively eats about 1/3 of the usuable volume (5 of 21 available litres). It also makes the ruck rather top-heavy, causing it to collapse into itself when not fully packed. However, this isn't necessarily much of an issue: when trying to retreive something from the Harney Pouch while out and about, I usually stand the GR0 up straight, leaning it against one of my legs, or hoist it over one shoulder in front of my chest.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/473edab354.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch in the empty Goruck GR0"></p>
<p>This is what the GR0 looks like when I'm going somewhere without my laptop:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/000773eaae.jpg" alt="f-stop Harney Pouch in the filled Goruck GR0"></p>
<p>For reference: Light waterproof jacket, 0.5 l stainless steel bottle, Tasmanian Tiger TacPouch (used as an organiser for smaller items), specs case for my sunglasses, and a specs case that I use for my earphones.</p>
<p>If I take the laptop with me, it's stored in the appropriate compartment in the back while its accessories and backup hard drive are organised in a <a href="http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=61&product_id=154">medium-sized Cocoon Grid-It! organiser</a> and stored in the main compartment. With all of the above already in the Goruck GR0, there's still enough space for some food and a light fleece sweater.</p>
<p>In larger Goruck backpacks the volume of the Harney Pouch will have a comparatively smaller impact on the available space of the backpack. And if I really need the internal space of the GR0, I can also attach the Harney Pouch to the outside of the GR0.</p>
<p>In conclusion I can say that it's hard to imagine a more fitting solution to carry my camera gear within the Goruck GR0 than the f-stop Harney Pouch. Inside the backpack it gives me quick access to my camera gear while staying out of the way when I pack my stuff. Outside the GR0 it is a sturdy, well-made, versatile, spacious (enough), and comfortable camera bag. Considering what it does, $ 75.- (I paid € 55.-) isn't too much to ask.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/05/21/a-few-thoughts.html">A few thoughts about Windows 8 and the Surface Pro 3</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/05/21/a-few-thoughts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-05-21 09:00:00 &#43;0100">May 21, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I use Apple devices most of the time, but in recent months I had to use Windows 8.1 as well, both for my thesis and my job. The way I'm using Windows 8.1 is in a virtual machine on my 2013 13" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. I also have a second MacBook Pro (an old one from 2008) that runs Windows 7 in Boot Camp).</p>
<p>Windows 8 can be a great OS and an incredibly frustrating one to work with. The positives are that it feels very lightweight and lean compared to Windows 7 and Vista; it has a fairly small footprint in terms of storage requirements and resource consumption; it's fairly secure; I actually like the Start Screen, but then I also like Launchpad in OS X; the flat design is visually pleasing and well-implemented.</p>
<p>The one thing that I can complain about, regularly drives me bonkers. It's a schizophrenic OS that doesn't really know what it wants to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't need touch screen-optimised gestures on a PC that doesn't have touch screen, they're hard to discover, hard to remember, and even harder to use with a mouse or a trackpad.</li>
<li>I <strong>hate</strong> that there are settings that can only be made in one part of the UI, while others things still have to be set in the Control Panel. I have a high tolerance for this kind of stupidity, but there are enough people I know that get so frustrated by this, they're afraid of changing any setting.</li>
<li>Oh and feature discoverability in general is pretty bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've said this before and I'll say it again: Microsoft should've taken a page out of Apple's book and gone with Windows RT for tablets and Windows 8 for laptops and desktop PCs. Proper optimisation and strict UI requirements for Windows RT applications would've made this entire mess avoidable and would've benefitted not only the users but also Microsoft in the long run.<br>
But unfortunately the c-level at Microsoft was too timid to let go of the past and backwards compatibility, too afraid of what their partners and businesses would say.</p>
<p>In Germany there's a word for what Microsoft was trying to accomplish with Windows 8: They tried to create an 'eierlegende Wollmilchsau'.<br>
Loosely translated it means 'jack of all trades', strictly translated something like 'egg-laying wool-milk-pig', and we all know that those don't exist — or shouldn't exist, depending on your stance on genetic experimentation ;)</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The Surface Pro 3</em></p>
<p>I'm actually excited about this device and I look forward to trying one. It won't get me to switch from my MacBook Pro with Retina Display and iPhone, but from everything I've seen and read so far, Microsoft managed to produce a device with exceptional build quality, listened to what users looked for in a Tablet PC, and improved on the already good Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>I had the chance to try the Surface Pro 2 a couple of times and found it to be the single most enjoyable Windows 8 tablet to date (my points of comparison are tablets by ASUS, ACER, and HP) and it set the bar very high for third-party manufacturers.</p>
<p>I'd have no qualms recommending the Surface Pro 2 or the new Surface Pro 3 to someone who wants a Windows tablet. They're certainly better than anything by ASUS, ACER, HP, DELL, and the rest right now. The only exception to this is Lenovo; while they, too, produce a lot of crap, the Thinkpad T43x series of laptops and the Thinkpad X23x series of convertibles are genuinely good devices.</p>

			 <p>When I bought my first good camera a few months ago one of the big questions was how I wanted to carry and use it. Before the Fujifilm X-E1 I used a Panasonic DMC-LX3 and always carried it on a wrist strap. The X-E1 is substantially bigger and heavier and I wasn't sure whether to get a wrist strap as well, or rather a neck strap or one of those new-fangled sling straps.</p>
<p>During my search I was introduced to many products by many companies: Crumpler, Gordy, BlackRapid, SunSniper, LowePro, Artisan & Artist, Joby, Clik Elite, Luma Labs, and many more.<br>
The raw utility, customisability, and the quality varied as heavily as the prices and the more expensive products usually weren't the best or nicest looking ones.<br>
The general consensus regarding neck and sling straps seemed to be, that tripod-mounted solutions came loose more often than one would expect and didn't inspire confidence.</p>
<p>One company that was often mentioned in passing was OP/TECH, a U.S. company that has apparently been around for years. A few quick checks at the major online retailers revealed that its products were generally well-liked, sturdy, and reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity I purchased the <em><a href="http://optechusa.com/utility-strap-sling.html">Utility Strap - Sling</a></em>, and the <em><a href="http://optechusa.com/slr-wrist-strap.html">SLR Wrist Strap</a></em> from OP/TECH. (The price for both items and a few additional connectors was lower than the price of one BlackRapid sling strap.)</p>
<p>At first I was a bit anxious because they use quick disconnects and like many people I've had the occasional bad experience with these kinds of connectors from other companies. These, however, seem to be exceptionally sturdy and well-made, locking in place with a satisfying <strong>CLICK</strong> and no wiggle room.</p>
<p>It turns out that my anxiety was unwarranted. I've been using the two straps for about three months now, during hikes, walking around town, a few (business) trips and pretty much everywhere I took my camera to and at no point did I fear that the straps or the couplings would come loose on their own.</p>
<p>I can't say that the OP/TECH gear is the nicest looking solution, but it's certainly the most versatile and functional I've seen (having tried products from BlackRapid and Crumpler in the meantime). I can quickly change between having the X-E1 dangling from my wrist, to having it on the sling strap, to attaching it to one of the shoulder pads of my Goruck GR0 using a spare OP/TECH connector and a carabiner.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/05/07/and-i-still.html">And I still don&#39;t like 3D movies</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/05/07/and-i-still.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-05-07 07:47:00 &#43;0100">May 7, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Someone in the movie industry must still think that 3D movies are a good idea and I think this person needs to be told to take a step back, then another step back, a few more steps back, leave the building and never come back again.</p>
<p>The most recent movie I watched in 3D was 'Captain America — The Winter Soldier'. Why did I watch it in 3D? Because it's not being shown in 2D and I wanted to see it in the cinema.<br>
Or to put it another way: I was pretty much <strong>coerced</strong> into watching it in 3D because no cinema in the region shows the movie in 2D. To be <strike>allowed to pay to</strike> able to watch it in 2D, I was going to have to wait for the BluRay release.</p>
<p>Tell me how that makes sense? The movie industry is essentially telling me that I will love 3D even if they have to force me love it.</p>
<p>3D is nice in theory but there's only one movie I watched so far that did 3D "right" — in the sense that you can make 3D right and feel like something more than a novelty. That movie was 'The Hobbit'. It was filmed in 3D from start to finish and it's the only movie where 3D didn't feel like it was a tacked-on feature to get that badge on the movie poster.</p>
<p>The Hobbit was also best case scenario for 3D. Here the feature felt like a fun addition that didn't make me enjoy the movie more, but it also didn't diminish the movie watching experience.</p>
<p>Every other time that I watched a 3D movie in the cinema I was annoyed</p>
<ul>
<li>by the stupid glasses which are uncomfortable and limit your viewing positions, thus making me tense up,</li>
<li>because the 3D doesn't match with the filming style of the director and makes the movie feel hectic and all over the place,</li>
<li>by the mediocre post-production 3D effects that look bad, have wrong perspectives, and unnatural depth of field effects,</li>
<li>by the fact that the price mark-up for 3D movies is ridiculous,</li>
<li>because the glasses are single-use and produce unnecessary waste.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind I decided that I won't watch 3D movies anymore. I wanted to watch the second Captain America movie because it ties into the recent Marvel releases and I like what they are doing here in terms of the story. Still, I'm not going to watch the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie in 3D, even though it, too, ties into Marvel's larger storyline. Luckily the latter is not the case with the new Spider-Man movie and the new X-Men movie or Godzilla. I'm not going to go and watch them in the cinema if they're not being shown in 2D, or any other movie for that matter.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear cinemas, movie distributors, movie publishers, movie studios, movie studio executives,</p>
<p>I love going to the cinema. I love handing the cashier in the cinema my money. If the movie looks promising I even shell out the obscene € 10.- for some popcorn and a soft drink without hesitation.</p>
<p>I won't, however, watch any more 3D movies. They're just not worth it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For the past six years my primary computing devices have been iPhones, iPads and Apple computers. Five days ago I was given an ASUS Nexus 7 by my employer for testing purposes. Here are some of my first impressions.</p>
<h4 id="thedevice">The Device</h4>
<ul>
<li>The form factor of the Nexus 7 feels strange. Having used iPhones and iPads for years a 16:9 screen feels alien for browsing the web and reading books and other written content.</li>
<li>The build quality is good. To be honest I was surprised by this. It's not comparable to current Apple tablets or even the Microsoft Surface 2, but on the other hand the Nexus 7 costs a lot less. With the exception of the SIM card slot I'd equate the build quality and the perceived density of the device to an iPhone 3G.</li>
<li>I'm not a fan of soft-touch coatings on devices and the Nexus 7 is no exception. They feel interesting for a while, but when they wear off the devices look crappy. Admittedly the coating on this tablet is among the best I've seen so far and I'll reserve my judgement for when it has been used a few months.</li>
<li>The cameras, both front and back, are decent but nothing to write home about — which is perfectly fine for me as they only need to deliver good video quality for video calls and the occasional snapshot.</li>
<li>The display itself is stunning; colours are great, viewing angles, too. Watching videos on it feels more natural than reading articles on the internet.</li>
<li>The speakers are lousy, but at least the headphone port is decent.</li>
<li>The buttons on the side are nice and firm and react precisely.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="theoperatingsystem">The Operating System</h4>
<ul>
<li>One thing I noticed immediately was that the interface is a bit laggy. This tablet is one of the fastest Android devices out there, yet iOS 7 on my iPad 2 from 2011 feels more responsive.</li>
<li>The system (Android 4.4.2) is a bit overwhelming to be honest. The amount of customisablity—some, it seems, just for the sake of it—often has me second-guessing myself. I won't deny that Android is powerful, but it demands a lot from the user. The learning curve is very steep and I think that the average user won't ever scratch the surface of what it can do.</li>
<li>The way Android approaches home screens and applications reminds me very much of Windows. Instead of a number of apps I have five small desktops that I can customise to a certain degree, but all my apps still reside in the applications menu (like the start menu). Another system I feel reminded of is my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5">Psion 5mx</a> running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)">EPOC32</a>, the precursor to Symbian.</li>
<li>I'm not thrilled by the widgets. I already installed a good number of apps but with the exception of a few, widgets are rarely more useful than an icon with a badge. I have a good weather widget installed and the GMail widget, but most widgets seem to have been designed as an afterthought. Google's widgets show that there's potential, but I've seen nothing really compelling so far.</li>
<li>The way notifications are handled is great. Same goes for quick access to core features of the device. Apple has nailed the latter with Control Center in iOS 7, but it's very clear that Android was the inspiration. Notifications are something that Apple definitely needs to work on, because right now it's neither here nor there.</li>
<li>Having access to the filesystem has certain upsides but also a lot of downsides. Personally I like not having to deal with a filesystem in iOS, <em>but</em> it's great that on Android more than one app can access the same file without requiring me to move it between apps. Allowing an app to see, open and modify all files it's capable of opening on the entire device, is something I will need before I can truly start replacing my laptop with an iPad.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="thesoftware">The Software</h4>
<p>There are very few applications I miss. The ones I do miss are pretty specialised apps that not many other people will find useful, but the most important ones all have fairly decent equivalents or acutal counterparts. The biggest drawback I see in most apps is that they don't integrate (well) with the third-party services I use (like Pinboard) but your mileage may vary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSS:</strong> On iOS I use <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder 2</a> syncing with <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>. On Android I found <a href="http://twentyfivesquares.com/press/">Press</a>. It's only a few bucks and possibly the best RSS reader on Android right now. It reminds me heavily of the old Reeder on the iPad and I really enjoy using it.</li>
<li><strong>App.net:</strong> <a href="http://riposteapp.net">Riposte</a> + <a href="http://">Whisper</a> is what I use on iOS for ADN and ADN private messages, on Android <a href="https://www.robinapp.net">Robin</a> is my app of choice at the moment. It looks great, makes even greater use of the tablet's screen (especially in landscape mode) and is very responsive. The only oddity is that I can't seem to filter out conversations as well as in Riposte.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Nothing beats <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios">Twitterrific</a> on iOS for me, on Android <a href="http://getfalcon.pro">Falcon Pro</a> seems the way to go, even if setting it up is more than convoluted thanks to Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Movies:</strong> <a href="http://www.eplayworks.com/section/product/avPlayer.php?lang=en">AVPlayer HD</a> might have a slightly odd interface, but has very meaningful gesture controls and deals well with different file formats. On Android the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html">VLC beta</a> is the way to go for now.</li>
<li><strong>Skype:</strong> I use the service very often and the Android app is not only a lot nicer than the iOS app, it's easier to use and more responsive. It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
<li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> Similar to Skype, the Dropbox app seems a lot more useful on Android than on iOS and the UI is much nicer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are my first impressions of the device and the software. In a few weeks I'll write some more, once I've really gotten to know both.</p>

<p>In the most anticipated announcement in physics since the discovery of the Higgs Boson, the first detection of a gravitational wave has been reported. If verified, the find will dispel any lingering doubts about Relativity theory, transform our understanding of the universe&rsquo;s beginning and provide astrophysicists with a new tool to probe the universe. The importance of the detection is hard to overstate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this discovery can be verified, the effects it will have on astronomy, cosmology and astrophysics are hard to put into words.<br>

			<h1><a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/03/12/a-few-thoughts.html">A few thoughts about the Pono</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.mangochutney.me/2014/03/12/a-few-thoughts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-03-12 16:17:00 &#43;0100">Mar 12, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I'm very sceptical about the Pono.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/03/12/neil-youngs-pono-kickstarter-crushes-fundraising-goal/">Dave Mark over at the Loop</a> wrote a short but thought-provoking piece about this new digital audio player, linking among other things to a <a href="http://routenote.com/blog/pono-music-is-the-worst-audio-player-i-have-ever-seen-steve-jobs-would-laugh-at-its-design-and-technology/">pretty bad and overly negative piece</a> that didn't really address issues that go beyond taste and personal preference.</p>
<p>The design is not an issue. To each his own. Even when Apple was crushing the DAP industry with the iPod, companies like Cowon and iRiver did their thing and still sold devices. The latter two and a few others gained a reputation for delivering great sound, better than the iPod's and that reputation was well-earned. Until the iPod Classic came around they definitely used the better audio chips, took more care in designing the circuit boards, which resulted in objectively better sound.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are players like the HiFi-Man that not only do what the Pono can do already, but also cater directly to the kind of people that the Pono will try to win over. What's more—and that's something the Pono will have to prove—is that the HiFi-Man delivers enough power to drive big expensive and small and expensive headphones and in-ear monitors without the need for a separate amp.</p>
<p>But where I'm really sceptical about the Pono (and the HiFi-Man for that matter), is that the audio files they can play, the fidelity they claim to offer, is nearly impossible to appreciate by humans.<br>
Back when the Pono was first announced, Christopher "Monty" Montgomery of the XIPH.org Foundation (makers of the OGG codec) wrote a <a href="http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html">great article</a> about the limits of human hearing and why to even the best ears, 24 bit/192 kHz music doesn't sound better than 16 bit/48 kHz.<br>
It's well worth a read to understand that whatever claims will be made about the device's audio quality prowess, is most likely going to be voodoo, misdirection and lies aimed at nothing but selling devices and music.</p>
<p>Even worse, a possible debate what constitutes good audio quality might not revolve around <em>"Having a good offering of losslessly encoded music would be amazing!"</em> but <em>"24/192 or death!"</em>, akin to the megapixel race that brought us ever smaller digital cameras with small chips and big numbers that amounted to no better pictures than the generation before them — thankfully the photography industry has found its way out of this mess.<br>
This debate will be led by a small groupp of very loud people who listen to gear rather than music, who value the numbers and specs of the technology they listen with more than the what the technology was made for. To quote my friend Darby Lines: "<a href="http://www.theangrydrunk.com/2013/05/08/nerds-ruin-everything/">Nerds ruin everything</a>". This breed of audiophiles <a href="http://www.the-ear.net/review-hardware/audioquest-ethernet-cables-pt2-ethernet-cable">is deluding themselves</a> and has already created an industry around them that sells <strong>$ 1000.-</strong> ethernet cables for better audio quality — a digital connection, mind you.</p>
<p>I love music. I'm also a fan of good audio gear. My home system is a well set-up Yamaha Pianocraft E400 and my mobile setup is my iPhone and a pair of <a href="http://www.westone.com/music/index.php/products/um-series/um-product-archive/um3x-rc.html">Westone UM3X RC</a> with custom earmolds (frankly my favourite earphones so far; not the objectively best earphones I've ever had, but I simply love the tuning). I'm also a proponent of losslessly encoded music, because it sounds a lot better than what is being sold in the iTunes Store or on Amazon at the moment. But there are limits to what we can hear and I think that having Apple, Amazon and others offer FLAC or Apple Lossless files in their stores would be a greater step in the right direction than the Pono ever will be.</p>
<p>(It would save me from having to still buy CDs among other things.)</p>

			 <p>Remember the NCPPR?<br>
The National Center for Public Policy Research?<br>

The organisation that was told by Tim Cook to get out of the AAPL stock if they didn't like the way Apple operates?</p>
<p>Well, they wrote a rebuttal after the shareholder conference, accusing Apple of only faking ecological responsibility and Tim Cook only faking anger when he told the NCPPR off.<br>
It's pretty much what you'd expect from an organisation like this.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><p>A recent work trip brought me to a very beautiful region on this planet. This and the prospect of a few other nice trips this year led me to the decision to buy a new camera, since my Panasonic DMC-LX3 has started to show its age in terms of picture quality, compared to modern mirror-less interchangeable cameras and—believe it or not—my iPhone 4S.<br>
I opted for a <em>Fujifilm X-E1</em> with the <em>Fujinon XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS</em> lens and I got a good deal for it, seeing that the X-E2 had just hit the market.</p>
<p>Being still new to the camera—and admittedly not quite awake—I made a mistake when setting the date once I was in the destination timezone, resulting in the date stamps in the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_Image_File_Format">EXIF</a> data being off by -2 years and -6 hours in every picture. Of course I only noticed that once I sat in my home office again, while importing gigabytes of pictures into <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>.<br>
This is where it started to go downhill, because while Aperture seems to do a fine job of processing the RAW file format Fujifilm uses, it doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to change the EXIF data of the files.</p>
<p>After a lot of searching, the only viable solution turned out to be a command line application called <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a> by Phil Harvey.<br>
It allows for <a href="http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/Shift.pdf">date and time shifting</a> using an easy syntax — &ldquo;easy&rdquo; once you&rsquo;ve stopped feeling intimidated by the prospect of using a command line application for a task like this.</p>
<p><em>The following workaround has been done on a Mac, but since exiftool works on Windows, Linux and OS X this can be applied to other setups as well. On Windows there&rsquo;s actually a nice GUI application called <a href="http://www.geosetter.de">Geosetter</a> that uses exiftool in the background, making the entire process even less intimidating.</em></p>
<p>I initially thought I had to export everything from Aperture into a folder and then let loose exiftool on the exported files like a hungry hyena, but it was much easier than that. Seeing that each Aperture library file is a glorified folder, you can right click it in the Finder and select &lsquo;Show Package Contents&rsquo; from the context menu. A folder will open, showing the contents of the library.<br>
Inside that folder the master files are kept in the folder &lsquo;masters&rsquo; (Duh!), sorted into subfolders for years, months and (approximate) days and times.</p>
<p>Now to the actual use of exiftool for my problem:<br>
I wanted to change all date tags inside each photo (EXIF data contains more than one date tag and I wasn&rsquo;t sure which one Aperture would use or if it would get confused if it found two different dates in one file). As I had set the X-E1 to capture both a RAF file and a JPG at the same time, I needed it to change the JPG date and time stamps as well.</p>
<p>After closing Aperture the first problem I faced when running exiftool on a few files was that it returned minor errors and warnings like this;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Non-null bytes found in padding …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and subsequently didn&rsquo;t process files that returned errors.  I thought that there had to be some way to still process these files and a quick search for the warning turned up a forum thread and the maker of exiftool provided an <a href="http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,3961.msg18594.html#msg18594">answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I can tell, the non-null bytes in the normally-empty section of the RAF image aren&rsquo;t referenced from anywhere, so I&rsquo;m thinking that they are just garbage data.  I&rsquo;ll update the next version of ExifTool to make this a minor error, allowing the file to be written with the -m option.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;<em>-m</em>&rsquo; option you say? A quick look into the documentation revealed this explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-m (-ignoreMinorErrors) Ignore minor errors and warnings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, here&rsquo;s what I did:<br>
I opened a Terminal window and entere the command</p>
<p><code>exiftool -AllDates+=&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo; -m /Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</code></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the command does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>exiftool</strong> launches the application.</li>
<li><strong>-AllDates</strong> changes all dates tag within a picture.</li>
<li><strong>+=</strong> tells the app that the adjustment will advance the dates into the future (&lsquo;-=&rsquo; would put them into the past).</li>
<li><strong>&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo;</strong> changes the date by &lsquo;2years:0months:0days 6hours:0minutes:0seconds&rsquo;.</li>
<li><strong>/Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</strong> represents the location of my photos or a single file in the Aperture library package/folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cool thing about the way the Terminal works in OS X, is that you don&rsquo;t even have to type in the folder path manually — a source of many frustrating errors.  Instead you can drag the icon next to the title of the folder from the Finder window into the Terminal window and place it behind the command (don&rsquo;t forget the space between &lsquo;-m&rsquo; and the folder path).</p>
<p>What resulted in the folder were .RAF and .JPG files with changed EXIF data and .RAF_original/.JPG_original files, the latter being the original files exiftool kept as a backup. I removed these files from the folder and put them in a backup location on my hard drive until I was sure that the new files not only had the right date, but were also intact.</p>
<p>I started Aperture again, and after a few seconds it realised that the dates had changed and started to rearrange the files. Having changed quite a lot of files, it took a couple of minutes to re-process the photos, but afterwards everything looked great and all photos had the correct date and time associated with them.</p>
<p>In summary this shouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary. Aperture—being the advanced application that it supposedly is—should be able to change date and times stamps as well as every other piece of EXIT and IPTC data I want it to change, because mistakes happen. Thankfully exiftool and similar applications exist, allowing users to make these changes and I&rsquo;ll be sending Phil Harvey some money because his work saved me a lot of headaches.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a condensed version of the workflow I used to change the date and time stamps in the EXIF data of my photos:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Aperture.</li>
<li>Open the Aperture library package/folder by right-clicking it in the finder and selecting &lsquo;Show Package Contents&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &lsquo;masters&rsquo; folder and the subfolder holding the pictures that need EXIF data adjustments.</li>
<li>Open a Terminal window and type the following command <code>exiftool -AllDates+=&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo; -m</code>. Add a space behind the &lsquo;-m&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Drag the folder icon left of the title of the folder in the Finder window and drop it behind the command.</li>
<li>Hit return on the keyboard and wait for exiftool to finish processing the files.</li>
<li>Move the .JPG_original/.RAF_original/.XYZ_original files to a backup location outside the Aperture library package/folder until the successful adjustment has been confirmed.</li>
<li>Launch Aperture, select the project in question and give Aperture some time to re-process the photos.</li>
<li>If the desired changes have been applied correctly and Aperture doesn&rsquo;t show any errors or wrong EXIF information, delete the backup files.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Chowdry's—and feel free to replace him with any other so-called analyst—claim is that Apple's doomed because they've destroyed shareholder value as the stock fell from ~ $700 to ~ $400 (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/15/suppressing-aapl">and we all know how that happened</a>).</p>

			 <p>Ever since the announcement of Google Reader's shutdown I started to notice something around the web, a trend of sorts.</p>
<p>Amid the discussions about successors to Google Reader and frankly idiotic proclamations about the demise of RSS, I saw that RSS buttons were given a more prominent placement on sites again. Often I was greeted by a popover or sidebar badge that not only explained how to get notified about new content through Twitter or email newsletters, but also told me that there's a working RSS feed if I want to subscribe. Sometimes I was told plainly that just because Google Reader was going the way of the dodo, RSS wasn't about to stop working, usually followed by links to articles explaining how to add RSS feeds to popular browsers or email applications. (I noticed similar messages and announcements on a smaller scale when FeedBurner started acting up a few months ago, and many sites started to jump ship.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown">Marco Arment wrote a good—albeit a bit over the top—article</a> about what RSS has to offer in a world where companies like Google, Facebook and increasingly Twitter are trying to lock users into their version of the web; an open, decentralised solution for spreading information that isn't owned or controlled by one person or company.</p>
<p>It seems as if Google's axing of Google Reader reminded website owners and users of this fact, and that's a good thing.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>First off: I'm happy for the team behind Tumblr and I believe that it'll benefit the platform in the long run.</p><hr /><p>A little backstory for those who are interested in it:</p><p>When I first got serious about maintaining a personal site, I took a look at all the alternatives out there and decided to sign up with Tumblr. Previously I had used a site made with iWeb; it was nice, but not being able to add posts on my iOS devices got on my nerves quickly.</p><p>Tumblr was my home on the web for a long time, but at some point the limitations imposed on users became too much for me and I starting looking for alternatives. My search lead me to Squarespace, right when they transitioned from version 5 of their CMS to version 6.<br></p><p>At the time it was a good choice, because Squarespace offered;</p><ol><li>more customisation options than Tumblr,</li><li>the promise of good iOS applications,</li><li>and a clear company-customer relationship.</li></ol><p></p><p>Unfortunately Squarespace v6 has steadily gotten worse since I signed up. While I'm still their customer on paper, the changes that are made behind the scenes that directly impact the functionality and look of my site, without me having a say in them, speak a different language.</p><p>On this front, the only advantage I have over Tumblr is the lack of ads in my CMS (Squarepace's excellent support and <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/press/2012-11-1-fuel-buckets-keep-new-york-data-centre-live-through-the-hurricane" target="_blank">dedication to uptime</a> notwithstanding). Tumblr's iOS app is the best on the market right now, while Squarespace's app is slow, buggy, doesn't work well with v6, and often breaks things on the site when used.</p><p>And last but not least there's the fact that the only export format Squarespace offers today is Wordpress XML. The one thing I cannot stand when using paid services, are companies trying to lock me into their platform <strong>with my own content</strong>, when I'm already paying them.</p><p>At this point I'm on the verge of moving my site to a static site generation engine that's self-hosted on some dedicated server (most likely <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com" target="_blank">Pelican</a>). It would be a lot of work, but it would also mean that I'd have complete control over the site and wouldn't have to deal with crappy CMSs (one can add posts by uploading Markdown-formatted text files), making the site leaner as an added bonus.</p><hr /><p>Tumblr's acquisition has me perking up my ears. I might be willing/able to cancel my plans of going full-on neckbeard with my site (see above) and go back to Tumblr, if two things happen:</p><ol><li>Tumblr@Yahoo! introduced a true paid option that not only removes ads, but also makes it clear to them and to myself that I'm their customer, not advertisers or other third parties.</li><li>They reintroduce (in the paid plan if they want) simple options to import to, and export from Tumblr.</li></ol><p>I just want an easy way to write articles and post funny pictures, knowing that I own my content and can take it anywhere I want, if I want to.</p>

			 <p>Gestern habe ich mit einigen Freunden im CinemaxX in Trier "Iron Man 3" geschaut. Trierer die diesen Eintrag lesen werden fragen wieso ich nicht ins <a href="http://broadway-trier.de" target="_blank">Broadway</a> gegangen bin? Nun, im Broadway läuft der Film leider nicht.</p><p>Der Film war unterhaltsam, aber mir wurde mal wieder sehr deutlich vor Augen geführt warum ich so ungern ins CinemaxX gehe:&nbsp;<em>Es ist alles darauf ausgelegt den Kunden abzuzocken.</em></p><p></p><p>Ich spreche hier noch nicht einmal von den völlig überhöhten Kartenpreisen an sich, nein, der Grund meiner Unzufriedenheit ist der Kartenkauf, bzw. die Kartenreservierung auf der Seite von CinemaxX:</p><p>Man kann entweder;</p><ul><li>Karten per Reservierungssystem vorbestellen, die man 30 Minuten vor Beginn des Filmes abholen muss, ohne Möglichkeit einen Sitzplatz auszuwählen: "Sie erhalten automatisch die zum Zeitpunkt der Reservierung besten verfügbaren Plätze". — <em>Das finde ich zwar nicht prickelnd, aber es ist in Ordnung, wenn man früh genug reserviert oder es einem egal ist wo man sitzt.</em></li><li>Karten telefonisch sitzplatzgenau reservieren. Das ganze funktioniert natürlich nur über eine kostenpflichtige Rufnummer und man zahlt einen Aufschlag pro Karte von € 0,50. — <em>Hier stellt sich für mich schon die Frage wieso ich einen Aufschlag zahle wenn ich ohnehin eine kostenpflichtige Rufnummer wählen muss. Wozu ist dieser Aufschlag da?&nbsp;</em></li><li>Karten direkt online zu kaufen. Hier kann man sich auch den Sitzplatz aussuchen, zahlt aber eine Vorverkaufsgebühr von € 0,50 pro Karte. — <em>Wieso eine Vorverkaufsgebühr? Der Kartenverkauf wird nicht von einem <a href="http://www.eintrittskarten-tickets.de/ticket-lexikon-vorverkaufsgebuehr-vvk-gebuehr/" target="_blank">externen Vorverkäufer</a> abgewickelt, sondern von CinemaxX selber, über deren bestehendes System. Habe ich irgendwelche Vorteile aus dem Kartenvorverkauf die außerordentlichen Kosten auf Seiten von CinemaxX gegenüberstehen? Sind die Karten im Vorverkauf günstiger als an der Abendkasse? Außerdem stellt sich mir jetzt die Frage ob ich bei Wunsch der Kartenrückgabe die&nbsp;<em>Vorverkaufsgebühr</em><a href="http://www.rechtslupe.de/steuerrecht/ust/refundierung-der-vorverkaufsgebuehr-beim-verkauf-von-konzertkarten-339699">&nbsp;r</a><a href="http://www.rechtslupe.de/steuerrecht/ust/refundierung-der-vorverkaufsgebuehr-beim-verkauf-von-konzertkarten-339699" target="_blank">ückerstattet bekomme</a>? Aber nein, denn bei CinemaxX kann man gekaufte Karten ja gar nicht zurück geben. Wozu hier die&nbsp;</em><em><em>Vorverkaufsgebühr</em>?</em></li></ul><p>Mir drängt sich folgendes auf: Diese Aufschläge, Vorverkaufgebühren und ähnliche Preisspielereien sind nur dazu da die hohen Ticketpreise auf den ersten Blick ein wenig niedriger wirken zu lassen. Das kennt man von Reiseveranstaltern, Fluggesellschaften wie RyanAir und anderen Dienstleistern. Es wird dem Kunden vorgegaukelt, dass er einen Mehrwert erhält, der separat bezahlt werden muss, wenn da tatsächlich kein Mehrwert ist, der über die Grundleistung hinausgeht.&nbsp;Es ist nichts als eine <strong>Täuschung des Kunden</strong>.<br>Besonders da CinemaxX durch den Kartenvorverkauf online keine Kosten entstehen die über den grundlegenden Betrieb eines Reservierungssystems und einer Zahlungsabwicklung hinausgehen entstehen. Man kann mit Verlaub sagen, dass diese Systeme&nbsp;heutzutage&nbsp;zu den Grundkosten eines Kinos gehören. Außerdem&nbsp;spart es CinemaxX sogar Arbeit/Geld, da Kunden mit bereits gedruckten Karten (oder solchen die sie sich am Automaten im Kino abholen) nicht weiter abgefertigt werden müssen.</p><p>Bei der telefonischen Kartenreservierung frage ich mich was die Begründung für den "Aufschlag" ist. Mehraufwand durch telefonische Beratung? Ok, aber wieso dann die kostenpflichtige Rufnummer? Mehraufwand an der Kasse? Verursachen Kunden die regulär ohne Reservierung Karten kaufen weniger Aufwand? Oder solche die einfach ohne Sitzplatzvorauswahl Karten reserviert haben?</p><hr /><p>Meinem Unmut habe ich per Twitter ein wenig Luft gemacht, auch da ich weiß, dass CinemaxX ganz gut mit Kunden über diesen Dienst kommuniziert. Das ist der derzeitige Stand der Unterhaltung:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Es ist echt beeindruckend wie kundenunfreundlich @<a href="https://twitter.com/cinemaxx">cinemaxx</a> mittlerweile ist.

			 <p>Today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/galaxyonfire/posts/562504693771424" target="_blank">Fishlabs linked to</a> an interview with its CEO Michael Schade <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/9/4203206/galaxy-on-fire-alliances-is-a-way-to-expand-the-universe-and-appeal" target="_blank">on Polygon</a>.&nbsp;One of the topics was the question whether a developer can deliver a premium gaming experience with a Free-To-Play business model. Michael Schade seems to think so.</p><p>I think it's going to be a difficult task. Delivering a high quality game while at the same time trying recuperate the cost of development and marketing through a FTP model results in the creation of a <strong>thin red line</strong>.</p><p>On one side of this line players are going to enjoy the game but won't have much incentive to spend money. On the other side of the line players have no possibility to significantly advance in the game and enjoy it without spending money over and over again on&nbsp;In-App-Purchases (<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2013/02/27/real-racing-3-review-vastly-raising-the-graphical-bar-while-adding-loads-of-timers-and-iap/">see the Real Racing 3 travesty of a game</a>).<br>Apply this logic to&nbsp;an online multiplayer game and that line becomes even thinner than in offline games, because it means a player (or a group of players) with sufficient funds can&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;gain so much power that other players will lose interest.</p><p>Walking that thin red line is what Fishlabs has chosen to do.</p><p>That being said, I believe that in previous <a href="http://galaxyonfire.com/en/galaxy-on-fire-home.html" target="_blank">Galaxy on Fire</a> titles they've made good use of&nbsp;IAPs, limiting them to things that make the experience nicer, help the player progress a little bit faster, or give her/him a little edge, but nothing that'll completely alter the difficulty and thus the over-all experience of the game.<br>Because of this I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, but as we've seen with recent titles on the App Store, customers are increasingly sceptical of (high-profile) games that rely heavily on&nbsp;In-App-Purchases.</p><p>All that remains to be said is: "Viel Erfolg Fishlabs!"</p><p></p>

			 <p>I've loved wearing Chucks ever since my dad bought me my first pair of low top Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars in beige when I was seven years old.</p><p>The healthiness of wearing these shoes might be debatable; I've owned at least one pair for the last 15 years and my feet/knees/hips are very healthy. The quality of these shoes is also debatable, but I've learned over the years that if I don't wear them daily—which I rarely do with any shoe—a pair of high tops will last 1.5 years before they need to be replaced (e. g. fall apart).
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/applechutney/20153721888/in/dateposted/" title="Converse Chuck Taylor All Star"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/20153721888_29e51f76b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Converse Chuck Taylor All Star"></a></script></p>
<p>All in all they're dependable shoes that I know what I'll get out of.</p><p>What I hate though is the price, or at least the markup this particular brand/model of shoes carries in Europe. To illustrate:</p><ul><li>I bought two pairs of high top Chucks in a sports store on&nbsp;<strong>NYC</strong>'s Time Square in 2009 for the regular price of ~ € 35,–</li><li>I bought the pair pictured above for € 42,– on the <strong>internet</strong> in 2011</li><li>A regular pair of high tops goes for breathtaking € 65,– to € 70,– in <strong>German retail stores</strong>, and—oh wonder—you won't find them cheaper in brick and mortar stores in almost any town in Germany. If you think collusion is in place here, you might be right.</li><li>During a few trips to eastern <strong>France</strong> in the last couple of years I've seen that they usually go for € 65,– to € 75,– over there as well.</li></ul><p>Why am I telling you all of this? Well, I lived in <strong>Beijing</strong>, China for a while and there I bought genuine high top Chuck Taylor All Star shoes for—hold on to your hats—a mere € 12,–. How do I know they were genuine? Well, I was able to compare the pair I had just worn out to the new one, and they were identical down to the last stitch.&nbsp;I approached the store owner and she told me that even at this price she makes a decent profit off of them.</p><p>I'm of course not saying that German retailers should offer them at Chinese retail prices, but think about this: even considering shipping costs and intermediaries the online retailer I bought a pair from three days ago (they'll arrive tomorrow) still gets a profit margin of over 200% out of them.</p><p>Certain types of brick and mortar stores are dying in Germany—shoe stores that don't perform well in six months usually disappear—but when I see a markup of 450% and more compared to what I paid in China and 50% to what I pay online, I don't see how I'll ever buy a pair of sneakers in a regular store ever again.</p><p></p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/21/no-thanks-google/" target="_blank">Jim Dalrymple linked to</a> a piece by Om Malik regarding Google's new note taking/saving service called Google Keep (an <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> clone). Jim's comment on the matter was the following:</p><blockquote>How can Google expect users to trust them with an app when they could shut it down at any time. No thanks Google.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I have more faith Google keeping Google Keep alive than Reader.&nbsp;From the data mining perspective it makes a lot of sense:<br>Reader gave them data on what you read, what sites you're interested in, but even this was a—potentially huge—haystack from which Google still had to pick the things you're really interested in, only slightly aided by the fact that you might've shared one or the other article using the buttons on Google Reader's web interface.</p><p>Google Keep will give them insight into the things that are important enough for you to have them saved permanently.&nbsp;It has the potential to give them data that's more useful than what they get from search, because you're doing the filtering and the only thing you save are the pertinent bits.&nbsp;It removes a huge amount of uncertainty for them.</p><p>Combined with data gathered through their search products and various social networks, Google not only knows what it is you're really interested in, but—in some cases—also how you came to acquire that information. After a while this'll make predicting your (re-)search behaviour and decision process a lot easier for them.</p><p>Last but not least there's the data from the real world that you input that Google might've had close to no access before. Users will be saving photographs of information they need to remember in there, maybe some documents and other random pieces of data that Google would've not seen before. All available for them to analyse and store.</p><p>What this means for Google is the ability to tell their customers that they have a more complete picture of the product (= you) they're buying.</p><hr />As an aside:<br>I've been an Evernote user for many years, since the first private beta actually, and even though the service has many problems and I've pretty much stopped using it, I was glad that it has always been a service that didn't rely on the company selling my data to make money.<p></p>

			 <p>I stumbled across this introductory video for Facebook's news feed redesign on <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672077/news-feed-tries-to-fix-facebooks-hardest-problem-engagement">Fast Co.Design</a> and something rubbed me the wrong way about it. Check it out for yourself.</p>

</div>


<p>Sure it's nicely done and it succinctly showcases the new design and how it'll benefit users, but something is missing. One quick glance at my own newsfeed reminded me what it was: the ads. The news feed in the video and in all of the promo materials I could find (doing a quick search online) had no advertisements in them. This is the first sentence you hear in the video:</p><blockquote>So when we talk to people about how we can make their news feed better, one of the things that we heard over and over again was “My news feed is cluttered.“ […]</blockquote><p></p><p>Yes, it is cluttered; with ads. This is the part that has been conveniently left out. A quick check of my own news feed revealed that four out of twenty entries were straightforward ads. I'm not even counting the ‘person xyz likes this company’ entries or sponsored posts.</p><p>I'm not complaining that <em>there are</em> ads on Facebook, after all Facebook is no charity and it's offering a service used by millions for the price of having our data sold to third parties so they can attempt to show us tailored ads.<br>What leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth is the way Facebook is sugarcoating these changes by omitting one of the most essential parts of the user experience. In the end ‘uncluttering’ the user's news feed from potentially irrelevant entries by your friends, will also mean that Facebook is going to have an easier time delivering ads in that same news feed that we users will have a harder time ignoring (or telling apart from actual entries by our friends).</p><p>The news feed redesign has received well-deserved praise <a href="http://davidchartier.com/we-do-not-own-our-audiences-attention/" target="_blank">from smart people</a> and I have to concur, it looks great and might solve a couple of basic problems the current iteration suffers from, but not showing one of the main aspects of the Facebook experience is disingenuous to say the least.</p>

			 <p>iTunes 11 is not a good piece of software. In many places it has made organising your music/media collection a pain for anyone who owns more than a couple hundred of songs. Apple has been rightly criticised for improving an already mediocre product for the worse.</p><p>iTunes's purpose is to serve mainly as a gateway for the user's content, in this case letting you import CDs to put them on your iDevice(s) — and if you really like Apple, you can then push your ripped CDs to iTunes Match so they can live happily on a fluffy cloud with all the music you've bought from Apple directly.</p><p>With that in mind, here's something Apple did well in iTunes 11:<br>The user interface and workflow for importing CDs has actually&nbsp;been&nbsp;improved.<br>Apple has made it very easy to edit information for the entire CD as well as download and upload (!) CD information to Gracenote's CD-database.</p><p>But the biggest boon is the application asking how to encode the CD each time the 'Import CD' button is pressed.&nbsp;In previous versions you had to open the application preferences each time before importing a CD if you wanted to use a different encoder.</p><p>If you have a lot of CDs to import, being able to quickly&nbsp;choose&nbsp;whether to import a CD using the Apple Lossless encoder (for complex music, such as orchestral recordings) or the AAC encoder (for less complex music like pop) can be very helpful.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>

The price has been dropped back down to its original price of $299. Belkin’s Thunderbolt Express Dock was quietly introduced in September of 2011 and made an official debut as a prototype at CES 2012. However, in June of last year, the device was changed a bit and had its price raised by $100. Fortunately, Belkin has just announced that it will be bringing the price of the device down by dropping eSATA support.</blockquote><p>The &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; price point of $ 399,– was absolutely ludicrous, but the old/new one isn&rsquo;t significantly less stupid.</p><p>Sure, Thunderbolt is still a niche interface and will continue to be as long as manufacturers don&rsquo;t decide to release more products for it — oh, and drop the price for cables to a sensible level. As of now it&rsquo;s pretty much a technology for professionals.<br></p><p>So, with the current range of Apple computers in mind, <em>wha</em><em>t&rsquo;s the target group for this device?</em></p><p></p><ul><li>Macbook Pro users get at least one Thunderbolt port, two USB3.0 ports, an audio output and some kind of digital video output for their money.</li><li>Mac mini and iMac users get tons of ports on their computers, too.</li><li>What remains are MacBook Air buyers who for some reason need more than two USB3.0 ports at the best possible transfer rates (meaning that a decent USB3.0 hub somehow isn&rsquo;t good enough) <em>and</em> FireWire 800 <em>and</em> an Ethernet jack <em>and</em> audio ports (I&rsquo;m interested to know how these audio ports compare to even the cheapest USB audio card).</li></ul><p></p><p>Belkin is making a mistake, because even professionals will think twice before buying an accessory this expensive, when the computers able to leverage the power of the Thunderbolt Express Dock are usually a) pretty expensive from the get-go and b) mostly feature a decent range of useful and fast ports by default.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Continuing this train of thought, you have to consider that Apple offers the <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Thunderbolt Display</a> for $ 999,–. The latter is not only a decent display for the price (compared to displays with similar specifications), but it&rsquo;s next iteration will most likely have USB3.0 as well. Now imagine a user who plans to buy a good display and also wants to leverage the benefits of the Thunderbolt port on his or her machine. The price difference between a good display + the Thunderbolt Express Dock, versus the Thunderbolt Display isn&rsquo;t very big.</p><p></p><p>The niche for the Thunderbolt Express Dock is tiny and becomes only a bit bigger if you include older machines (like the 2011 Mac mini I&rsquo;m writing this on). For those it constitutes an upgrade of sorts. The benefits from my perspective would be the additional FireWIre 800 port and, most importantly, three fast USB3.0 ports. Still, it&rsquo;s hellishly expensive and costs about a third of what I paid for my top tier 2011 Mac mini.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really curious about the cost of production per unit; it would give a hint as to whether Belkin can&rsquo;t price this thing lower, or if they don&rsquo;t want to — the latter of which would be perfectly fine, stupid, but fine.<br>If I had to price this device for the consumer (or even the prosumer), I wouldn&rsquo;t cross the $ 199,– mark if I could help it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p></p>

			 <p>… but it's not for a lack of trying.</p><p>A few weeks ago a friend of mine who had recently switched to a Mac, asked for help in finding a good email client, because Mail.app didn't feel right. The environment that friend is working in results in large numbers of emails that end up in his inbox every day and he has to send a lot of them, too.</p><p>He was coming from a perfectly customised installation of Thunderbird, that he'd been using for years without a hiccup. Due to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/mozilla-scraps-thunderbird-development-email-client-not-a-priority-anymore-7000000469/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Thunderbird's state of developer support</a>, his employer is starting to prohibit its use and recommends moving to Outlook; so Thunderbird wasn't an option for the Mac. The application in question needs to handle Exchange, IMAP and two POP3 accounts (six in total).</p><p>Our first try was Outlook 2011 for the Mac, which proved easy to set up—especially the Exchange accounts—but overall less capable than the Windows equivalent, a bit buggy, poorly integrated with OS X, and in the end too much of a behemoth to be useful to him.</p><p>As I was a beta tester for <a href="http://postbox-inc.com" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Postbox</a> before it hit version 1.0, I thought we should give it a try. The application is based on Thunderbird, uses the same underlying architecture for user data (e.g. profile folders, configuration files) and most Thunderbird extensions are compatible with Postbox. The application also uses an interesting approach to folders and attachments, which would've made it an even better fit than Thunderbird.<br>The lack of Exchange support was the first hurdle, but since his employer also provides IMAP access to emails it wasn't a deal breaker. Setting up the accounts was pretty easy (I used the same information that had been saved in Thunderbird) and migrating the POP3 inboxes to Postbox was equally painless (Thunderbird, Postbox and Mail.app all use the MBOX-format for storing emails).</p><p>But now the problems started:<br>Even though all IMAP accounts were protocol-compliant, Postbox wouldn't handle the folders properly. A lot of deleting and moving was necessary to make it a) see all the folder and b) load all messages within.<br>Next was a lack of support for the system dictionary and spellcheck routines. Postbox, just like Thunderbird, relies on user created dictionaries and translations, which often simply aren't good enough. With everything set up the app did it's work for about three days. Then for no apparent reason—no error messages popped up, the logs showed no changes or errors—Postbox wouldn't connect to <em>any</em> SMTP server. Receiving emails worked fine, but he couldn't send any. After reading loads of FAQs, support entries, troubleshooting guides and forum posts, I tried and failed to fix this by;</p><ol><li>Deleting and reentering all login data from Postbox.</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Postbox entirely and reimporting all data.</li><li>Deleting everything, reinstalling Postbox importing the original Thunderbird profile.</li><li>Setting up a new user on the machine and manually installing everything there.</li><li>Manually setting everything up on a mint system (I usually have a spare HDD lying around with a SuperDuper! clone of a mint OS X installation).</li><li>Checking if my router blocked certain ports (a long shot, since I use the same ports for my email accounts), but it also didn't work in his work network and Mail.app was still sending and receiving just fine with the same data.</li></ol><p>Nothing worked. It turned out that this is pretty much a known and unexplainable bug in the underlying architecture of Thunderbird and Postbox: For some reason at some point Thunderbird/Postbox refuses to connect to SMTP servers. Not one proposed fix worked and this isn't even limited to OS X; there are also reports of users on Windows Vista/7 having the same problem.<br>What pushed me/us over the edge was the lack of customer support for the developers of Postbox. If you're not a paying user who bought Postbox in a very specific time period (my old contact email didn't work), you cannot reach the devs through any means. This is what a desperate customer finds on their support pages:</p><blockquote>We have found that the best way to service Postbox customers is to help them, help themselves. In fact, 96% of Postbox users find the answer they're looking for right here on our Support Portal.</blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote>Please note that we do not offer one-on-one support offerings to new users at this time. All support efforts are currently dedicated towards providing better documentation and self-help solutions so that our users can more quickly find the answers they need.</blockquote><p>We were thankful that there's a 30 day trial period for the app and even more for the fact that the error cropped up before my friend had to buy the application. For a paid application—even if it's only $ 9.99—this is unacceptable.</p><p>In the end I helped him set-up Mail.app and tweak it to his liking. It might not be perfect and he misses one or another feature from Thunderbird, but it works.</p>

			 <p>Remember a few months ago when Tim Cook announced during an Apple keynote that the company would have something in stock for Mac Pro users in 2013? Well, today Mr. Cook announced in an interview that Apple is planning to produce an entire line of Mac computers in the USA. You can watch the video <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/rock-center/50095631" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">here</a> (link courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcaolo/status/276665507455852544" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Dave Caolo</a>).</p><p>When asked how much a product like this would cost, Cook said that the price wasn't going to be an issue when producing over here, which is curious. He also said that it wasn't so much about bringing high tech manufacturing <em>back</em> to the U.S., but bringing it to the U.S. in the first place.</p><p>There are two things that came to mind when he said this:</p><p><strong>1.</strong><br>Cook is an operations mastermind and if anybody can make this happen in a way that is viable for Apple, I believe it's him.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><br>The computer I could see being manufactured in the U.S.A. is an updated Mac Pro line. The reasons are the following:<br><em>Firstly</em>, with these machines price really isn't much of an issue; the Mac Pro has been the most expensive product in Apple's line up for a long time. A price bump due to the higher production costs in the U.S. should be accepted more readily by customers who are willing to spend upwards of $ 3000,– for a PC anyway.<br><em>Secondly</em>—and more importantly—Apple doesn't have to churn out huge quantities of the Mac Pro in a short time. They can give workers in the U.S. the time to do their job in order to guarantee the quality customers expect from Apple.</p><p>The last thing that I think is not to be misunderstood is Apple's reasoning for doing this: This is not a political move. From my understanding of the company, it's another attempt by Apple to exert more control over the manufacturing process of their devices. This is something they have to sacrifice when producing in China.</p>

			 <p>Now that I'll be reviving my early 2008 MacBook Pro, I remembered that the small detachable plug  of the power supply broke a few weeks before I stopped using the machine. I didn't really matter so I didn't replace it. Now that I'll be using the machine again—I actually believe that it's going to become my main machine again while writing my thesis—having a small plug and thus a compact power supply seems useful.</p><p>I called-up the local Apple Premium reseller to enquire about that availability of this small piece of plastic and metal and was told that they have them in stock. When I asked about the price my jaw dropped: € 19,–<br>A second call to another reseller yielded the same result. I kid you not, this small thing costs exactly as much as a brand new 12 W iPad power supply.</p><p>You see, I have nothing against premium pricing, but this just seems stupid, not greedy but stupid. Putting a prohibitive price on a spare part for something that can break so easily (mind you, in the European version, the contacts aren't retractable) simply makes no sense to me.</p><p>What am I going to do? Simple, I'll get the 12 W power supply and use the 10 W one as a spare. Faster charging times for my iPad 2 and iPhone 4S <em>and</em> a new plug are a much better deal than the alternative.</p>

			 <p>Anybody who has opened an electronic device once in their life has seen a chip cooler/fan combination that keeps the silicon chips cool.<br>This way of controlling the temperature of electronics is pretty old, fairly inefficient and tends to be pretty noisy. The innovations made in the last few years in the field of computer hardware and consumer electronics are mostly concerned with reducing the noise that is emitted by the fan. In their latest flagship laptop, Apple has introduced a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/design/" target="_blank">fan with asymmetrically spaced impeller blades</a> that leads to a lower operating volume by spreading the sound produced across a broader range of the frequency spectrum.</p><p>In the future cooling might work a bit differently, at least if the researchers at <a href="https://www.sandia.gov" target="_blank">Sandia National Laboratories</a> have anything to say about this. They have developed a cooling unit that works without a fan or any kind of thermal compounds that are usually put between the cooler and the chip.</p><p>All of this is still in prototype stage, but it looks extremely promising. You can find out more about this technology by following the link below or watching the embedded video.</p>

			 <p><p>Realmac Software has a nice post on their blog, outlining a few tips on how to keep your iOS device secure. The one I didn&rsquo;t know about involves the passcode lock:</p><blockquote>Before you Turn Passcode On you should consider whether to turn Simple Passcode off. With Simple Passcode on you will set a 4-digit number, with it off you can set a longer alphanumeric passcode. Longer alphanumeric passcodes are more secure but also a little more fiddly to enter on the lock screen as you&rsquo;ll be presented with the full keyboard instead of the numeric keypad. But here&rsquo;s a pro tip where you can get best of both worlds. If you have Simple Passcode off and set a long passcode that only contains numbers the lock screen will now present the numeric keypad instead of the full keyboard. Now you can choose a longer, more secure numeric passcode which is both easier to remember and quicker to enter that an alphanumeric one.</blockquote><p>Pretty nifty if you ask me.

  <p><em>We learnt the hard way that we really needed to rethink marketing. I don't think it works at all.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how many developers have only just learned that you need to know your way around marketing terms and advertise your work, this is a daunting prospect. <br />
Fortunately Mr. Reil also told the audience that judging from his experience when dealing with mobile devices and AppStores the icon and name of the application are immensly important, and;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>You can go viral in the old fashioned way on these devices. People will go out to a pub and show your game to their friends if they really like it. Very often it's because of production values and overall graphics. This is where we have a huge opportunity. We always want to wow people.</em></p>

<p>In other words: Quality is what it's all about.</p>

			 <p>As we've found out yesterday, OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion is going to be released to the public today.</p></p>
<p>This year I've decided to take a slightly more relaxed approach — e.g. I don't plan on doing a clean reinstall — but certain steps should always be taken before a major OS update. So here's what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Check if the apps that I use on a daily basis are Mountain Lion compatible. This can be easily done using the site <a href="http://roaringapps.com">RoaringApps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Backup my user data with Time Machine. This works pretty fast in my case, because I do TM backups on my Mac mini's secondary internal drive.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone my Mac mini's primary HDD with <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a>, twice. I have one backup that goes to a FW800 HDD, usually updated daily and a secondary backup on a USB2.0 HDD that I won't touch until I'm fairly certain that 10.8 works fine. Of course, I checked the integrity of both backups, by booting from them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Mountain Lion can come.</p>

			 <p>The appointment of Marissa Mayer as Yahoo's new CEO caught almost everybody by surprise. Even more surprising was the shockingly small number of proclamations of doom, despair and disaster for Yahoo as a result of her appointment.</p>
<p>Most seem to think that Mayer, having been one of Google's best, is capable of at least turning Yahoo around, making it relevant again. Her <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/">initial memo to the company's employees</a> certainly makes her seem more level-headed than most CEOs these days; it looks as if she knows what's at stake.</p>
<p>(If you want to listen to a good discussion about Ms. Mayer and what she might mean for Yahoo, listen to <a href="http://5by5.tv/amplified/16">last week's episode of Amplified.</a>)</p>
<p>I wish her all the success in the world, but to be honest, I really only want Yahoo to fix Flickr. <br />
I wasn't upset when Yahoo bought the service, even forcing me to log-in with my Yahoo credentials didn't really phase me. What bothers me is the state of the service that has gone from <em>the</em> photo sharing site on the internet, to a spam-overrun site that people only use because there's no real alternative. At least there's none for those of us who just want an easy way to store and share our photos — 500px is nice, but feels more like a portfolio for professional photgraphers and ambitious amateurs.</p>
<p>Flickr needs to rethink these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>UI</strong>: This is the most obvious one. It's clunky, impractical, not optimised for anything and it takes to many steps to get anything done. The entire user experience is frustrating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community and sharing</strong>: While the sharing features have become better, Flickr's insistance on adding links to their service anywhere and everywhere when posting one's pictures online is annoying. Integration with third party services for sharing is rudimentary at best, the commenting system is close to useless and SPAM is abundant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orientation of the service</strong>: What's Flickr for? A portfolio for photographers? A place to save all your photos? A site to share your snapshots with the world? Else? Can it be all at once?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I realise that everyone has different needs and expectations of a service like Flickr, but these are the things I'd change had I any say in the future of Flickr:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user interface that puts my content left, front and center, giving me an easy way to showcase everything from quick snapshots to photographs I'm actually proud of. Hire some talent for the UI revamp. Off the top of my head I can think of a decent number of designers who'd be up to the task of helping make Flickr better, the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/">Iconfactory</a>, <a href="http://impending.com/">Impending</a>, <a href="http://www.pacifichelm.com/">Pacific Helm</a>, <a href="http://robocatapps.com/">Robocat</a> and <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Blackpixel</a> being among them.</li>
<li>Show photos in a way that gives the people I share them with the best quality whichever device they view them on.</li>
<li>Give the user the option to hide metadata, tags and other information on the site. This could be done as a per-user setting (<em>Always show metadata</em> or <em>Never show metadata</em>) or by making it visible at the tap/click of a button. It's the photo that's important, the EXIF stuff is uninteresting for regular users and secondary even for most geeks.</li>
<li>Make it easy for me to get my photos on Flickr by optimising the uploading process.</li>
<li>Offer an API for Twitter clients (and other services) that lets me push photos to Flickr from anywhere, retaining not only the photo's metadata but also information that puts the photo into context (like the tweet it was posted in initially). A second step would be to allow hotlinking in tweets, so photos shared via Twitter don't result in the client opening a slow and shitty mobile site that gives the user a picture not much bigger than a thumbnail.</li>
<li>Offer native apps that take advantage of devices's strengths and have their shortcomings in mind. For example: I'd expect an iPad app to deliver close to the same functionality the website does, while the iPhone app should let me easily view photos, upload and share them, as well as making it easy to edit/add basic information. </li>
<li>Emphasise sharing and commenting by pulling reactions to my photos from Facebook, Twitter and showing them alongside comments on Flickr. Oh and tell me when someone has commented on them — the current implementation of an activity stream on the site is pretty much useless.</li>
<li>Do something about mindless spam. Let me allow certain people to comment on photos, let me restrict the possibility for others to add my photos to groups, etc.</li>
<li>Most of my photos are important to me, they capture memorable moments and losing them would be disastrous. Allow me to backup my photos easily, giving me peace of mind that they're safe from things like harddrive failure on the one hand and prying eyes on the other hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I wouldn't change is the pricing scheme: A simple but limited free account and a pro account with all the bells and whistles for around $ 25,- (I wouldn't even mind it being a bit more expensive).</p>
<p>I was very close to deleting my account with Flickr a few months ago, but now I feel that there's hope for the service to become useful again. I guess we'll just have to be patient.</p>

My take on the situation can be found below and in the comments of the article on The Loop.</p><div class="sqs-link"><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/07/22/on-sparrows-google-acquisition/" target="_blank">On Sparrow’s Google acquisition</a></div><blockquote>I can get behind most of what Tabini wrote in his article, but not the quoted passage. In it he warps what he calls &ldquo;the simple reality of commerce&rdquo;. By definition customers who buy your products are stakeholders, they take a chance with your product and thus a stake in your business. This especially holds true for licensable goods like software as they are durables and not consumables like, say, toilet paper (here your business relationship and expectation ends once you&rsquo;ve wiped you butt with it).</blockquote><blockquote>Tabini says that you should buy software that suits your needs, not because you have some hopes about its future, yet when a person invests in software by form of a licence, they expect to get a certain use out of it that extends beyond using it once or twice. Buying and using software is more akin to a service relationship than to buying physical goods.</blockquote><blockquote>Now to be perfectly clear: I don&rsquo;t expect developers to support a piece of software indefinitely — not for free at least. The question of &ldquo;How long is long enough?&rdquo; leads to a wholly different world of pain, but as JimD has correctly pointed out, OS updates do tend to break software and Sparrow for the Mac and iOS haven&rsquo;t been on the market for very long.</blockquote><blockquote>The same holds true for Pulp for the iPad by Acrylic Software, an app that hasn&rsquo;t been around very long either and that I bought — yup, my fucking luck — three hours before the announcement of the acquisition by Facebook. After purchasing the app, I found out that certain essential aspects of the software didn&rsquo;t work as advertised, something I&rsquo;d expect the developer to improve on. Now that they&rsquo;ve been purchased none of this will happen and I basically have a dud sitting on my iPad.</blockquote></p>

			 <p>On my way home from work I witnessed the hubbub surrounding Google's acquisition of the fairly popular email client Sparrow, thinking to myself how   much this must suck for people that have bought a licence for Sparrow on iOS or OS X.</p>
<p>Well, a few minutes ago I stumbled on this post by John Moltz:
<em><a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2012/07/why-cant-we-have-nice-things/">Why can't we have nice things?</a></em></p>
<p>In it he quotes from this <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/07/20/facebook-acquires-ios-and-mac-developer-acrylic-makers-of-wallet-and-rss-reader-pulp/">TNW piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Mac development house Acrylic has announced that they have been acqui-hired by Facebook.</em></p>
  <p><em>[…] Acrylic says that Pulp and Wallet have not themselves been acquired by Facebook, but there are no plans to keep developing them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I purchased Pulp for the iPad today. Sigh.</p>

			 <p>Harry Marks has posted a <a href="http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/6/18/initial-thoughts-and-questions-concerning-microsofts-surface.html" target="_blank">nice list of questions</a> on his site Curious Rat, that he was left with after yesterday's presentation by Microsoft.</p><p>Not answering the most basic questions regarding a new device of this kind, like say " What is it going to cost?" and "How long does it typically run on one charge?" fills me with a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>The thing that really angered me, though, was this:</p><blockquote>Two separate processor architectures (Intel i5 and ARM) will give developers two separate platforms on which to build apps. Do they build for legacy Windows first, then if there’s time/resources, Windows RT? Or do they build for Windows RT and leave old-timey Windows in the past?</blockquote><p> It shows that (1) Microsoft still hasn't developed the balls to say goodbye to the legacy crap that's been holding them back for almost a decade now, and (2) these things have little chance of becoming actual competitors to the iPad.</p><p>I predict that the only software good enough to compete with iPad apps will run on the ARM tablet; which requires developers with a willingness to do the legwork on this new platform and the slightest hint of what good UI design looks like. I hope for the sake of customers and Microsoft, that Redmond will provide developers with a good SDK for Windows RT applications and even better support.</p><p>If that doesn't happen — and I'm quite sure it won't — we'll end up with a Windows 8 tablet that isn't better than a 10-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Compaq_TC1100" target="_blank">Compaq TC1100</a> running Windows XP. Why? Because most companies and lazy independent developers will stick to their guns and continue to build powerhungry, unoptimised, legacy crap that barely even runs on the Windows 8 tablet under the guise of offering "the full Windows experience".</p><p>The only way Microsoft can achieve any relevance in the tablet/post-PC market, is if they're willing to drag their customers and developers — especially the corporate ones — kicking and screaming into the current decade.</p>

Actually since each separate version was released — I own licences for the iPhone, iPad and OS X version.<br>Despite some minor annoyances the UI of all apps is second to none and it's easily one of the most heavily used apps on all my devices.</p><p>The UI of the new iPhone version is nothing short of spectacular and works very well, even though it's a bit laggy at times (I'm sure this is something that will be improved in a future release).</p><p>I'm not going to review the entire application, Mr. Viticci has done a thoroughly good job with that. What I want to mention is the integration of <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a> as the first true alternative to Google Reader since the demise of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a> as a publicly available RSS aggregator.</p><p>Shaun Inman's service might be a bit more difficult to set up for the average user and it requires a web server (you buy a licence for the Fever software which then has to be hosted on your server), but for me it has three advantages:</p><ol><li>It works perfectly fine as a regular feed catching service,</li><li>it's marquee feature ranks posts by importance and popularity based on several criteria, presenting the user with a "you don't have time to read all entries, but these you shouldn't miss" listing (more on this here),</li><li>and using Fever is going to eliminate the last reason for me to have a Google account.</li></ol><p>The one thing keeping me from buying some web space, a Fever licence and setting it up right this second, is the absence of a good Fever client for the iPad. As of now it's also unclear when Reeder's developer Silvio Rizzi will release Reeder for iPad 3.0.</p><p>I also hope that by the time Mr. Ricci has Reeder 3.0 for iPad ready to go, the app will also support in-app feed management for Fever accounts, which it currently doesn't and receive a better visual implementation of Fever's ranking feature (both are things the MacStories review criticises).</p><p>For the time being I'm going to enjoy reading my RSS in Reeder 3.0 for the iPhone, and I somehow get the feeling that it's going to be used more often than the iPad app.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>This machine is a gigantic, high resolution, unibody middle finger to PC makers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had time to poke and prod this notebook for about half an hour at a local retailer a few days ago, and the above is pretty much my assessment of the device.</p><div class="sqs-link"><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">The new MacBook Pro on Apple.com</a></div><p>A few words on the — in my eyes — non-issue of repairability:<br>(1) Only a very very small number of people would ever actually want to attempt it; (2) I don't care that the RAM is soldered to the logic board, because even 8 GB combined with a SSD will be sufficient for very long even for "power users" — forgive the dick quotes, I hate myself; and (3) like with the second generation of the MacBook Air, companies like <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Aura_Pro_Express" target="_blank">OWC</a> will probably release alternative SSD modules that fit Apple's home brew interface in the next two months.</p><p>Now to the interesting stuff:<br>I’m not so much impressed by obvious improvements like USB 3, the full flash storage architecture, the insane amount of RAM you can put in them, the faster SSDs, or the dual Thunderbolt ports. These are pretty sweet, though, and make me wonder just how many displays this thing can drive simultaneously :)</p><p>What I am impressed with is the amount of effort Apple put into making this machine what it is.</p><ul><li><em>Exhibit 1:</em><br>The retina display. Many people expected this, still, 2880 by 1800 pixels is simply incredible for a 15.4“ notebook panel. From what I’ve read, Sharp builds them and I’d love to know for just how long Apple has reserved — read: bought-up — all production capabilites for this component.</li><li><em>Exhibit 2:<i><br></i></em>Cooling vents that not only serve to let cool air get into the device, but also work as stiffening elements for the body of the notebook; making it even more robust without making it heavier and thicker.</li><li><em>Exhibit 3:<i><br></i></em>Fans with asymmetrically spaced blades and an improved airflow architecture that reduces noise. I would've suspected that this was born out of necessity, because the internal components needed to deliver the level of performance the new MacBook Pro offers, are going to produce a lot of excess heat. But accounts by <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/06/11/first-look-retina-display-macbook-pro/" target="_blank">Jim Dalrymple</a> and others suggest that it's very hard to get the notebook to even audibly spin up the fans, let alone become warm.</li><li><em>Exhibit 4:<i><br></i></em>The battery. Not only has this machine enough juice to run for seven hours, depite its power hungry innards — due to past experiences I believe Apple doesn’t overstate this number — it's also packed neatly and symetrically into the notebook and at the front of the casing, probaly giving it a nice centroid, comparable to a Lotus Elise ;)</li></ul><p>Not even a day after the announcement of the machine, I’ve seen reports by blithering idiots, neckbeards, trolls and New Media Douchebags deriding the new machine for being;</p><ul><li>Made by Apple — which is bad because Apple is _evil!_</li><li>Too expensive — GAAAH! Apple TAX! GAAAH!</li><li>A disappointment, because it doesn’t have feature X, Y & Z.</li><li>Not trumping every weird-ass gamer laptop on the planet based on specs.</li></ul><p></p><p>To all of these numbnuts I say this: I triple dog dare you to find me a laptop that;</p><ul><li>is built half as well — we’re going to figure out how to quantify this</li><li>has the same or a better display,</li><li>as well as proper OS and application support for the insane resolution,</li><li>has the same or a better runtime on one charge,</li><li>and compares well on the remaining specifications.</li></ul><p>All for the same or a lower price in the coming six months — hell, I’d be willing to give you a year. If you can manage this, I’m going to bake you cookies, write „Apple sux!“ on them and send them to you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><p>Another WWDC keynote in the bag. And what a behemoth of a keynote it has been. Not having had time to follow live blogs, I caught up on the announcements through the Apple’s video of the event and by reading up on the details on Apple.com and other good sites.<br>I know I&rsquo;m late to the game with my keynote recap, but there were many interesting software announcements too good not to be discussed.</p><p></p><p>My overall impression of the event and the announcements was that Apple is flexing its muscles. One major new hardware release, many minor revisions and upgrades and two OS updates at once. This should give the competition a glimpse at what Apple is capable of today, most even likely not even beginning to stretch their resources.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the rundown of the features I&rsquo;m most excited about:</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>iOS 6</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/" target="_blank">Siri</a> only available on the 3rd gen. iPad — This is kind of a bummer, but it’s in line with Apple’s product strategy, meaning it was to be expected and is probably hardware-related, at least to some degree.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#facebook">Facebook integration</a>: DUH!</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#maps">Maps</a> look simply beautiful, but having to compete against Google Maps and Google Earth is not going to be easy; Apple has their work cut out for them. The application will put pressure on developers of Turn-by-Turn Navigation apps, because just like on Android, the solution integrated into the OS might be sufficient for many people.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#photostreams">Shared Photo Streams</a> is a neat way to privately share photos without having to upload them to a social network. From the looks of it, the minimal design puts the content first and further sharing options second.</li><li><a href="#">Passbook</a> is our answer to how Apple thinks mobile payments should look like. I don’t see NFC appearing in Apple’s devices anytime soon.</li><li>The new features in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#phone">phone application UI</a> were long overdue. Android has had them for years and they’ve even existed in not so smart phones — those with memories that go back further than four years might remember.</li><li>I like the better handling of Messages across devices. When someone sends an iMessage to my phone number, I’m now going to receive it on my iPad and Mac, too. Great!</li><li>This one I’m extremely excited about, the Do Not Disturb feature. Seriously, what took them so long? Finally (yes, I said it) I won’t have to put my phone into Airplane Mode at night to have peace and quiet. Extra props for the fine tuned options.</li><li>I didn’t see Google show up in the search fields of iOS devices, only a generic &lsquo;Search&rsquo; term. Might there be a chance for additional search engines besides Google, Bing and Yahoo? I’m talking about DuckDuckGo of course. I’m trying hard not to get my hopes up.</li><li>The new store designs and China-centric features are appreciated.</li></ul><p class="text-align-center"><strong>OS X Mountain Lion</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">10.8’s pricing and upgrade conditions</a> are a thing of beauty. Microsoft should slowly start to get the drift.</li><li>Tighter <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#icloud">iCloud</a> integration should’ve been there in Lion, but maybe I’m the only one who thinks that way. Easier machine setup is a good thing, though.</li><li>At this point, the built-in <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#reminders">Reminders</a> app in iOS has replaced Things (by Cultured Code) for me. The implementation on the Mac (inside of iCal) has been far from good, but a native OS X Reminders app is going to make this complaint a thing of the past.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#notification">Notification Center</a> is a very welcome addition, but I’m interested to see what kind of apps will be able to take advantage of its APIs; only Mac App Store apps, or any kind of app?</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#powernap">Power Nap</a> is a very interesting and potentially useful feature. From what Apple states as the system requirement for it, though, you’ll need a Mac with flash storage. I wonder if it’ll work with Macs that’ve been retrofitted with SSDs?</li><li>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dictation">Dictation</a> feature will be an absolute productivity boon — especially with my Master’s Thesis looming on the horizon! I hope they’ve integrated some kind of fast language switching for this OS feature, because I’m definitely going to hop between English and German a lot.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari">Sharing</a> looks nice and I’m hoping for a public API so other services can make use of this — I just want to get rid of all those bookmarklets in my browser’s bookmark bar.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari">Safari</a> has received some good upgrades: Apple finally (yes, I said it again) got rid of the separate search box. Now, how about letting me set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine? The tab view is interesting, too, and iCloud tabs will surely come in handy. Apple’s attempting to improve password handling in OS X, let’s see how it compares to the likes of 1Password for regular users. The „Do Not Track“ feature and the ability to rename bookmarks in the bookmarks bar are welcome additions as well.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#autosave">Auto Save</a> has been taught two nice new tricks, too: It automatically moves untitled documents to iCloud and APPLE BROUGHT BACK „SAVE AS“! YAY! No seriously, I still need this feature rather often.</li><li>The oh-so benevolent Apple has decided that a permanently displayed <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#calendar">Calendar</a> sidebar is a good thing after all, same as a groups column in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#contacts">Contacts</a> app and they improved the date picker. Regarding the first two: Why the hell did they remove it in the first place?</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dashboard">Dashboard</a>: It just won’t die. Persistent little fella.

			 <p >Earlier today, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/HarryCMarks" target="_blank">Harry Marks</a> posted an article on his site rebutting an argument <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47536638">made by Jim Cramer of CNBC</a>. Here's the quote:</p><blockquote >When the smoke clears off this miserable Dell quarter, people will realize that Apple’s behind the destruction of the laptop,” Cramer said. “And with that destruction comes a world of hurt for just about everyone, save Apple.</blockquote><p ><a href="http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/5/25/apples-behind-the-destruction-of-the-laptop.html">Harry Marks replied by saying</a>:</p><blockquote >It’s not a matter of the iPhone and iPad obsoleting the laptop. Apple’s success isn’t just with iOS devices, it’s with MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros, too. What Apple has done is obsolete poorly-made computers, poor shopping experiences, and poor customer service.<br>Apple isn’t destroying laptops, it’s making its customers happy. What are the other guys doing?</blockquote><p >He hit the nail square on the head. The other companies aren't only not doing anything, they're not even thinking.</p><p >Not limiting this to the tech business, I believe we might be witnessing the decline of "Bullshit Companies"; companies that are trying to bullshit their (potential) customers in many different ways: By pre-announcing products that might never see the light of day, by making promises they won't even attempt to keep,  by adding asterisk after asterisk and footnote after footnote in order to shroud the truth about what they are trying to sell and last but not least with bad customer service.</p><p >Apple being the one of the forerunners here (and a gargantuan at that), I'm starting to see more and more "Non-Bullshit Companies", companies that seem to work by a very simple business principle:<br><em>Here's what we offer. We believe it'll make your life easier in this and that way. Nothing more nothing less. This is how much we want for it.</em></p><p ></p><p ></p><p >Among other things the wild success of social funding platforms (like Kickstarter) illustrates where things are going:<br>If you have an honest and good value proposition, people will pay for it. Not out of the goodness of their heart, but because they know they're going to get something out of it.<br></p><p ></p><p >Here are a few examples of this, that I've noticed around me lately:</p><ul ><li >A new bus company has started to take advantage of the fact that the Deutsche Bahn (Germany's predominant railway company) isn't properly serving the population of the region. They set up a bus route covering the major cities on the way from Luxemburg to Frankfurt Airport. Their prices are good, the service is executed well and they know how to communicate.</li><li>A local beer garden, situated in one of the most scenic spots in Trier (with everything from a great vista, large meadows to football and beach volleyball courts) put up a sign telling customers that they could use its accommodations and bring their own food, as long as they buy their drinks here. You have no idea how uncommon this is and I'm sure that this was not the case last year. I should add that their beverage prices are very decent and the service is excellent, which only adds to the positive impression. This tactic has gotten them a lot of good will from guests and from what I have learned their food sales haven't declined and overall business seems to have improved.</li><li>How funny it may seem, my cellphone operator o2 Germany is on this list. The company has many flaws and does plenty of things wrong, but they offer a post-paid plan that is as simple as it can be, not forcing me into a long-term commitment, while having per-minute and data prices that are decent even compared to prepaid plans.</li></ul><p >Customers are smarter than most companies think and those still believing that trying to fool customers is the way to go, are going to realise that "<em>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.</em>" will turn into "<em>Fool me once… FUCK YOU!</em>" more quickly than ever before.</p><p >People don't begrudge companies for making money (not even for making boat loads of it), they just hate companies who are trying to do so by making false claims and essentially ripping people off. Only those businesses that are trying to make money without feeling the need to scam customers will prevail long-term and prosper. These are the companies that will get the money I earn.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/14/sms-facebook">John Gruber linked to an article</a> over at the New York Times, which stated that Facebook's messaging system, Apple's iMessage and similar services are slowly reducing the usage of SMS around the world. He said:</p><blockquote>It’s hard to think of a technology that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/01/atts-text-messages-cost-1310-per-megabyte/">more deserves to die</a> than SMS.<br></blockquote><p>I have to disagree with that. SMS might be a limited standard in terms of what can be transferred, and as the link in Gruber's quote shows, the average cost for a SMS is incredibly high in the U.S.A. (even more so over here in Germany). Still, the service is useful, because 1. it is universally compatible with almost all types of cellular networks around the world and 2. because it's fairly reliable due to the fact that it works when a data connection (needed to send any kind of email, iMessage, Facebook message, etc.) cannot be established. More info on SMS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">here</a>.</p><p>The problem is—as it is so often—greed by the carriers. A simple network-inherent, ubiquitous functionality is marketed and sold at a premium, with nearly no price decline over the last ten years.<br>SMS doesn't need to die, carriers should just stop charging customers for a fairly limited service that costs them close to nothing.</p>

Although the last of NASA&rsquo;s space shuttles has now been retired, it is still fun to contemplate sitting at the controls of one of the humanity&rsquo;s most sophisticated machines. Pictured above is the flight deck of Space Shuttle Endeavour, the youngest shuttle and the second to last ever launched. The numerous panels and displays allowed the computer-controlled orbiter to enter the top of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at greater than the speed of sound and &ndash; just thirty minutes later &ndash; land on a runway like an airplane. The retired space shuttles are now being sent to museums, with Endeavour being sent to California Space Center in Los Angeles, California, Atlantis to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on Merritt Island, Florida, and Discovery to the Udvar-Hazy Annex of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. Therefore sitting in a shuttle pilot&rsquo;s chair and personally contemplating the thrill of human space flight may actually be in your future.</blockquote></p></p>

			 <p>David Chartier on Nick Denton's plans to reinvent online comments and publishing alongside it:</p><blockquote><a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/04/20/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-upside-down/"></a>Mathew Ingram:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In particular, Denton hopes that handling comments in this way will encourage the subjects of stories to become involved in rebutting these reports directly on the site, instead of calling him to rant at him about them. “I want to take all of those people and I want to have them in the discussion,” he says. “I want to see the story evolve and see the rebuttal, and the rebuttal to the rebuttal.” Not only does that produce drama — something Denton admits he has a fondness for — but he believes it could also help to get at the truth, broadly speaking.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>I’m not a fan of Nick Denton or his Gawker blog network in general. But if he thinks he’s found a way to fundamentally improve comments, I’m willing to listen.</blockquote><p>This, to me, looks like an excuse to produce more inflammatory, link bait content, do even less fact-checking for stories and let the readers do the leg work. In turn this will lead to more aggravated and stupid commentary, which will then be positioned on the site prominently, so even more people will become enraged and click Denton's links. A concept like this does nothing to further the evolution of online content. It's like he says himself; it produces drama and drama equals clicks.</p><p>I agree that Gawker's commenting system is crap, especially the rewards system. Quoting Denton himself:</p><blockquote>It was a terrible mistake. It doesn’t work because people game it — and the people who game it are the people with time and social-media expertise, and those are not the people with information or insight. What person who actually has a job and a reputation… would give a f*** about getting some little badge like they’re in high school? It’s patronizing.</blockquote><p>This new system won't improve this situation, it'll make it worse for readers and better for New Media Douchebags, including Denton; the loudest people will get the most attention from Denton's site—because that's what he wants, make no mistake here—while the sane commentary will be mostly ignored because it doesn't generate the oh so desirable hits.</p><p><em>Source: <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/04/20/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-upside-down/">Giga OM</a>, via <a href="http://windonaleaf.net/post/21549076116/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-on-its">Wind on a Leaf</a></em><a href="http://windonaleaf.net/post/21549076116/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-on-its"></a></p>

			 <p>Over the last two days a bug in OS X Lion has been driving me crazy:<br/>
My 2011 Mac mini simply wouldn&#8217;t go to sleep.</p>
<p>I tried everything: Pressing the power button on its back, clicking the sleep item on the -menu and pressing <code>⌘+⌥+⏏</code>. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>Then I hit the internet and started searching for solutions, this is what I tried:</p>
<ul><li>Is some kind of sharing function was switched on? — No.</li>
<li>Where any apps preventing it it from sleeping? — Not that I could see.</li>
<li>Any weird events in the system log? — Nope.</li>
<li>Does one of my USB drives malfunction and keep it awake? — No, again.</li>
<li>Are there any network connections open that might stop it from sleeping? — No.</li>
<li>Bluetooth issues? — Nope.</li>
</ul><p>I even performed a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2183" target="_blank">PMU</a> and a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964" target="_blank">SMC</a> reset, with no effect.<br/>
Essentially I didn&#8217;t know what was going on and I decided to call the Apple&#8217;s support hotline: After answering all the questions by the very nice representative I was still left with no solution.</p>
<p>I gave the internet one last try, stumbling on the <code>pmset -g</code> terminal command, which prints out a log of settings for hibernation and errors if any occurred. Nothing.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that earlier that day I had read that someone turned screen sharing on and off again to find out if it had any effect.<br/>
I turned on screen sharing in the sharing preference pane and hit <code>⌘+⌥+⏏</code>, eyes closed… The Mac mini went to sleep immediately.<br/>
I turned it off again and the mini still went to sleep as ordered.</p>
<p>This is one weird bug, where not having any kind of sharing functionality turned on causes the Mac to not go to sleep. Oh boy.</p>

			 <p>There&#8217;s a nice and very sensible post on The Loop regarding booth babes at trade shows (like CES and IAA). <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/flargh" target="_blank">Peter Cohen</a> quotes a Gizmodo piece by Mat Honan regarding the complaints about booth babes directed at the organiser of CES.
Read it <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/01/17/cea-president-calls-complaint-about-ces-booth-babe-irrelevant/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>A comment by a guest named &#8216;Coward Anonim&#8217; rubbed me the wrong way, though:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If companies want to pay them and they want to get the job, then  what is a problem?</p>
  <p>Can&#8217;t adults (18+ years) make decisions for themselves? 
  How the h&#8230; they are eligible to vote in a public election, then? Is not election more important???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Let&#8217;s leave the elephant in the room — the degradation of women to sex objects — standing there for a minute. Let&#8217;s also make a distinction between normally clothed female sales staff and booth babes.)</p>
<p>When I go to a trade show I go there for the products. If companies need scantly clad women to get my attention, I immediately suspect that their product isn&#8217;t good enough to impress me on its own.</p>
<p>I like women as much as the next guy, but I find the practice of putting scantly clad women on display at such shows insulting.
— <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because what the people hiring them are telling me, is that I&#8217;m so controlled by primal urges to serve every female in sight, that I&#8217;ll flock to every booth with booth babes.</p>
<p>Good products don&#8217;t need booth babes to be sold. Modern men don&#8217;t need booth babes to find those products.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good and honest post, with a healthy amount of profanity mixed-in.</p>
<p>My take is that sometimes it doesn&#8217;t make sense to add comments to a blog, but many bloggers, developers and journalists who used to have comments on their site, are simply being dishonest about the way the removal of comments influences a potential discussion.<br/>If you want a discussion on the topic you wrote about, allow comments or give people a way to make their opinions heard/read not only by yourself.<br/>If you don&#8217;t want a discussion, or simply don&#8217;t want to be disagreed with on your own site, you don&#8217;t allow comments.</p>
<p>Other explanations, like this one from MG Siegler;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earn your voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are just excuses so you don&#8217;t have to tell people the truth:<br/>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for your opinion as long as you&#8217;re not popular.&#8221; — which brings us back to what John Welch was saying. Go ahead, read his article.</p></p>

<p>Proper attribution is important and sometimes not that easy.<br/>Yesterday he posted a simple attribution rule that Chris Martucci lives by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My criteria for via links are simple: If someone points me to an article I did not find on my own (either through my RSS reader or at its original source), I’ll include a via. Likewise, if an article I found on my own links to a second article, which I then post to my weblog, I’ll link to the original source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing I do differently, is to also mention the site I found a link on by my own, if the author of the second article added even the slightest bit of value to the original post.</p>

<p>You can preach all you want about rooting your phone and hacking your tablet to do inane things, like control your refrigerator light, but my family was actually getting things done within 30 minutes of opening and activating their new computers - yes, computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ease of use and seamlessness are some of the things that convince many people of Apple’s products in my opinion.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with my parents lately: I gave them my MacBook Pro, pre-loaded with OS X Lion, MS Office, the current iLife apps and a few other nifty things that I knew they’re going to use.<br/>After about an hour of showing them around the OS and a few apps, my mother was hooked. Guess by which features?<br/>Mission control and full screen apps, gestures and auto saving.<br/>As long as the innards of OS X are somehow accessible to those who want or need to work with them, Apple can iOS-ify the system as much as they want, if it makes full-blown computers easier to use for normal people.</p></p>

It’s hard to count the number of ways it makes my life as a university student easier and my spare time more enjoyable.</p></p>

    <p>How many times have you been to a product website and seen big bold letters proclaiming that you can CONNECT and ENGAGE and DISCOVER? Every time I see that, I hit the back button, and I bet you do too.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s because it’s vague. It’s supposed to sound exciting, but it’s not.

  </blockquote>
<p>— <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/12/08/on_the_tab_labels_in_the_new_twitter_app" target="_blank">Brent Simmons</a> on Twitter’s new nomenclature. Spot-on.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with Brent Simmons’s statement. Having read the articles by <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/review-twitter-4-0-for-iphone/" target="_blank">Cody Fink</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/new_twitter" target="_blank">John Gruber</a>, I believe that—at least for me—Twitter’s apps (including the web app) have finally jumped the shark.</p>
<p>The new Twitter iPhone app seems to be aimed at new users and “casual users”. Now, why did I use this word, almost devoid of meaning, “casual users”?<br/>I don’t think “casual users” are those who sometimes check Twitter to see what’s up; from personal experience those users are more likely to interact with a small amount of friends/other users, meaning that the most important features of Twitter are the timeline, conversations and direct messages. DMs, for one, are hidden in the last tab of the app. From Gruber’s article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Me”. Oh boy. Stashed into this tab are your profile, your direct messages, your Twitter Lists, and the interface for switching to other Twitter accounts. This tab is the conceptual carpet under which Twitter swept everything that didn’t fit under “Home”, “Connect”, or “Discover”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened.<br/>As I see it, Twitter is trying to hone-in on new users and what it <em>thinks</em> are “casual users”; users who sometimes check Twitter to stay up to date on the <em>latest happenings</em>, <em>trends</em> and <em>product offers</em> and interact publicly with their friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>Again, Gruber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presumably, this Discover tab is the successor to the late and unlamented dickbar — where sponsors will be able to pay Twitter to promote products and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup. Combine that with what Fink found out about this tab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discover is supposed to get better over time. Depending on where you’re located, who you follow, or what topics you find interest in, Discover aims to offer suggestions around those things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until now Twitter’s applications allowed the users to make use of the service according to his/her needs, even the web app. Now Twitter is trying to steer users in a direction.<br/>For me this direction is called “We finally need a way to monetize this service.”, which Twitter perfectly entitled to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that means many users will now (have to) steer clear of Twitter’s applications. Thankfully there are alternatives; <a href="http://twitterrific.com/" target="_blank">Twitterrific</a> and <a href="http://www.stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a> cater to what I think are causal users; as they integrate DMs and @-replys and photos nicely into the timeline and create a seamless experience.<br/>On the other end of the spectrum there’s <a href="http://www.echofon.com/" target="_blank">Echofon</a> and <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/" target="_blank">Tweetbot</a>; two clients help the user make the most of almost everything Twitter has to offer and give him/her quick access to almost any kind of information.</p>
<p>I have found what I was looking for in Tweetbot. Tweetie and Tweetie 2.0 even more so, were the evolution of Twitter on the iPhone; the first clients that were more powerful than the website. Everything Twitter did to it after buying it, was adding features and altering it. Tweetbot has everything I loved in Tweetie 2.0, but with even more useful features, all packaged in a design that makes everything very accessible and a pleasure to use.</p></figcaption></p>

<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://ephemera.wisser.me/post/13877031098" target="_blank">jwisser</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PAJNntoRgA" target="_blank">Rick Perry:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian, but you don’t need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there’s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the most breathtakingly offensive and reality-denying political ads I’ve seen from an American politician. It suggests that Christians are somehow persecuted, rather than the dominant religious and political force in the country. It suggests that gay people serving the nation that has long denied them full citizenship are something other than selfless heroes. And it states outright that children can’t “openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school”—both of which are blatant lies, unless something significant has changed without me hearing about it in the last six years. No, teachers can’t lead children in prayer—you may recall the establishment of religion clause, Governor Perry—but that didn’t stop a group of Christian students from gathering around the flagpole of my high school to pray several times a week.</p>
<p>Rick Perry is the same presidential candidate who yesterday said that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/rick-perry-says-human-rights-for-gays-not-in-americas-interests/" target="_blank">improving the lives of gay individuals abroad was “not in America’s interests”</a> and suggested that <em>not being killed or imprisoned</em> in nations like Uganda is a “special right”.</p>
<p>I’d really like to hear Rick Perry explain why it’s okay to burn <a href="http://costofwar.com/en/" target="_blank">over a trillion dollars</a> to kill brown people overseas, ostensibly to prevent them from killing people, but it’s not okay to make American aid to foreign countries conditional on those countries not killing or imprisoning their own citizens based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Somehow I doubt Jesus would agree with Governor Perry’s priorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Religious heritage”???</p>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Pilgrim Fathers came to ‘The New World’ because of religious persecution and the wish for religious freedom.</p>
<p>Furthermore I think someone should slap him with the First Amendment until he understands it — and not only the parts regarding religious freedom, but also those on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and interference with the right to peaceably assemble.</p>
<p>One last thing: Could this man be kindly reeducated on one of the pillars of modern democracy? It’s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" target="_blank">‘The Separation of State and Church’</a>.<br/>A quick quote from Thomas Jefferson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this guy gets elected president he might put the Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades to shame. I’m German—brought-up strictly catholic, turned agnostic—and I cannot do anything against scum like him, but <strong>crap</strong> like this video makes my blood boil.</p>

<p>Maciej Ceglowski, calling the “start a free web service, refuse to implement a business model, and eventually get bought” shenanigans for what they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not this is done in good faith, in practice this kind of ‘exit event’ is a pump-and-dump scheme. The very popularity that attracts a buyer also makes the project financially unsustainable. The owners cash out, the acquirer gets some good engineers, and the users get screwed.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, avoid mom-and-pop projects that don’t take your money! You might call this the anti-free-software movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great name for it. At this point, I am genuinely skeptical of free services or apps that can’t be bothered or flat-out refuse to implement some kind of a business model. I need tools and services I can depend on, not web services that get bought and shut down or pivot to chase the latest stupid trend, and definitely not free or open source apps that eventually get abandoned because they became too much work or the developers finally realized they need real jobs or had a kid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I wished Tumblr would start charging money for the service, even if only for some kind of premium variant. I love the service, but apart from a few themes I haven&#8217;t paid them directly. Tumblr going away—by shutting down or being bought—would mean a lot of work and headaches for me.</p>
<p>Many services could secure their existence and become even better by charging <em>something</em>. I gladly paid for <a href="https://simple-note.appspot.com/" target="_blank">Simplenote Premium</a> for two years, because I wanted one of the premium features and wanted to support the developers.</p>
<p>I like free stuff as much as the next guy—hell, I&#8217;m a student for chrissakes—but I believe that where people see value, they&#8217;re going to pay.</p></p>

			 <p>Yesterday the sequel to ‘<a href="http://epicgames.com/infinityblade/" target="_blank">Infinity Blade</a>’ by Epic Games was released. The initial reviews on gaming centric websites were almost unanimously <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/11/30/infinity-blade-2-review-an-ios-masterpiece/" target="_blank">positive</a>.</p>
<p>I downloaded the game this morning and took a few minutes to check it out.<br/>What I saw was impressive to say the least:</p>
<ul><li>Incredible graphics, diverse, changing environments and cutscenes</li>
<li>Gone is the tedious repetitiveness of the first title</li>
<li>New enemies with new moves and attacks, old enemies with a few new tricks up their sleeves</li>
<li>Improved sound effects, voice overs and music</li>
<li>New upgrade system for your inventory and a sleuth of new items</li>
</ul><p>There are a few bugs, mostly small graphics glitches, imperfect localisation (I also couldn’t find a way to set the subtitles from German to English) and it’s still annoying to see advertisements for game-related things left, front and centre. I didn’t have any crashes so far, which wasn’t the case for the first one, and I’ve noticed that the game manages to get my iPhone 4S pretty warm.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to spend more time with this game. <a href="http://infinitybladegame.com/" target="_blank">Go get it.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zach Holman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with shit work is that no one likes doing it, but an awful lot of people say they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree with almost everything in this piece. It’s based entirely on one core assumption that is wrong in so many ways, I told Siri to set a timer for how long I can take to respond to this.</p>
<p>Holman hates managing Twitter lists, Google+ circles, email folders, and task priorities, and leans on a couple anecdotes and process-alergic indie contractor Merlin Mann to argue that no one actually gets any value out of doing these things. That’s fine for the people who don’t really get these things, or those who don’t work in an environment where they are ever necessary. But a lot of people <em>do</em> get value from these processes in a variety of ways, from simple entertainment, to maintaining privacy while sharing online (which Holman shrugs off), to staying on top of crazy work schedules and informed on current events. Aside from the inevitable edge case examples, developers aren’t spending all this time on features no one asked for.</p>
<p>One of Holman’s punching bags is Twitter lists. He doesn’t like them, doesn’t see the point, and doesn’t know anyone who thinks otherwise. I love and increasingly use Twitter lists, and I personally know a bunch of people who do as well. Stepping beyond my single anecdote, though, you don’t have to spend much time to find <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mashable/lists" target="_blank">plenty</a> of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/4437400/Telegraph-Twitter-feeds-Who-to-follow-to-get-the-latest-news-reviews-and-pictures-straight-to-your-feed.html" target="_blank">others</a> who <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Favstar/lists" target="_blank">do as well</a>. I also found <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/" target="_blank">great</a> Twitter <a href="http://www.stone.com/tweettv/" target="_blank">clients</a> that do good things with lists and make them easy to use, and isn’t that half the challenge almost any work imaginable? If your tools suck, doing the work will likely suck.</p>
<p>I don’t need to trudge through every one of Holman’s “shit work” examples for you to get the picture. Just because you or like Merlin Mann doesn’t get or like a process doesn’t mean there’s no value in it, or that it’s “shit work.” Plus, leaning on a couple anecdotes to judge the big picture is just plain lazy. Writing these processes off because you don’t get them or don’t work in an environment where they can be useful is arrogant and ethnocentric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read the post by Mr. Holman and I came to a similar conclusion. If Mr. Holman doesn’t like those tools, fine, but writing them off because of it, is self-centered punditry that we can do without.
<br/>It’s black-and-white thinking of the highest (lowest?) order: “If a tools isn’t perfect from the get-go, the way <i>I</i> want it, it is shit altogether and nobody should even try to make it useful for them!”</p>
<p>To be clear: I don’t cherish the fact that I sometimes have to sit down and sort people into Twitter or Facebook lists. But the 15 minutes I spend doing this increase the value of both tools immensly for me. Same goes for RSS feeds; fairly regularly I weed through them, checking which ones are still worth reading and which aren’t.</p>
<p>Here are two examples:
</p><ul><li>Twitter lists: While I don’t follow many people, I have a few key lists set-up. One of those is a list of friends and people whose opinion I value. Using this list in <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot" target="_blank">Tweetbot</a>, I can quickly catch-up on recent happenings and discussions when I don’t want to go through 10 hours of my timeline.
<br/>Mr. Holman might object by saying that this isn’t the way to use Twitter. Who in their right mind will spend time reading tweets so far back? Well, I sometimes do.</li>
<li>Facebook’s new subscription feature: This is one of the most welcome additions to the service for me so far, because it allows me to select whose updates appear in my timeline. There’s a number of people I am friends with on Facebook, that I simply keep there to have a means of getting into contact without giving them my email address, but I don’t need to see every update of.</li>

<p>I just saw this video on the brilliant German Apple site <a href="http://www.fscklog.com" target="_blank">fscklog</a>.</p>
<p>It shows a new way to navigate text in iOS5, but it seems to be only available in Apple’s iWork applications as of now.</p>
<p>When trying to navigate inside a word for example, instead of invoking the magnifying glass — which can be unreliable sometimes — the user can now make short swipes to the left or right with one finger to move the cursor one character at a time.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope this is part of an official API, because I know a few apps that could make great use of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zach Epstein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But an interesting takeaway from yesterday’s announcement may simply be that Apple has fallen from grace in some respects. Apple is fallible, even if the 4S ends up being a success. A company that could do no wrong in recent history just, well, did wrong in the eyes of pundits who had previously viewed every Apple product announcement as a gift from the heavens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no, not the poor, never-wrong-in-a-million-years pundits! Say it ain’t so, BGR.</p>
<p>Related: can anyone offer a rational explanation as to why BGR is worth reading? Its rumors are consistently wrong and, in the last year or two, it’s stooped to publishing <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/10/03/sprint-guarantees-to-buy-over-20-billion-in-iphones-from-apple-launching-the-iphone-5-exclusively/" target="_blank">baseless pre-event bullshit</a> for pageviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Apple doesn’t give a shit what most of the pundits think and why should they. The disconnect between what pundits value and what consumers value is growing bigger and bigger and thus the irrelevance of pundits who equate their own needs with those of the average consumer.</p>
<p>These people will undoubtedly slam a feature like ‘Find my Friends’ because they don’t understand it or have no real use for it, and because of that it has to be worthless to everybody else. John Welch nicely paraphrased it in <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bynkii/status/121279168972472320" target="_blank">this tweet</a>.</p>
<p>As to BGR: It, Gizmodo, Engadget and the likes mostly exist so the kind of person I was talking about in the first paragraph can still feel relevant.</p></p>

<p>It hasn’t changed much since then, but after reading up on the iPhone 4S and all the improvements, I think it’s more than a worthy upgrade.</p>
<p>Most nerds, tech pundits and the likes won’t recognise this for what it is, but the consumer won’t care. The improved camera alone will sell this to millions of people. Bringing the iPhone on par with the iPad 2 in terms of raw processing power is another thing consumers will only realise when they pick up an older iPhone or any Android device and experience the sluggishness of the UI in general.</p>

<ul><li>We finally have a shipping date for iOS 5 and iCloud (Oct. 12th), which is what I was most interested in.
</li><li>The ‘Family and Friends’ feature is a nice addition that will surely come in handy sometime.
</li><li>The new watch faces for the iPod nano might be whimsical, but I think they are a nice touch.
</li><li>I think the Touch deserved some kind of hardware upgrade, not just a new colour, something like a storage bump to 128 Gb.
</li><li>The iPhone 4S is a logical upgrade, with a nice speed bump, longer battery life, impressive theoretical 3G speeds and an incredible upgrade to the camera. The latter feature is the most tempting for me, because I shoot a lot of pictures with my iPhone 4.

<blockquote>
<p>Via Electronista:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Best Buy hinted at possible sluggish sales of the BlackBerry PlayBook by starting a new sale on RIM’s tablet. The deal takes $50 off of the 16GB and 32GB tablets and a much steeper $150 off of the 64GB version, putting it at the exact same price as the 32GB model. The retailer hasn’t said how long the sale will last</p>

<p>I’ve seen how this story ends - the boat sinks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horace Dediu talked on <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/5" target="_blank">his podcast</a> about how HP’s fire sale of the TouchPad might negatively affect consumers’s price expectations for Android tablets and I think this is just the beginning.<br/>Anything that isn’t the iPad competes on price with each other and HP has just made RIM’s life a lot harder. </p>

<p>Yes. Worth the time to watch.</p>

<p>The presenter makes a great point. It might be a bit hard to swallow that sexy/demeaning pictures of women in advertising lead to violence against women, but no matter how many steps exist between an image and the act of violence against a human, because the assailant has decided that his victim isn’t human (enough), the point stands.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I find that Cindy Crawford looks orders of magnitude more beautiful in the left picture (shown in the video around time index 01:25) than in the right. I don’t like dolls, I like women.</p>

<p>Great tear down by Craig Grannell of Timothy B. Lee’s nearsighted Forbes piece, “Why Google is Winning the Smartphone Wars”</p>

<p>Here’s the deal - the “smartphone wars” have been imagined by pundits and analysts for a variety of reasons, including linkbaiting, stock manipulation and incompetence.</p>

<p>We have never been at war with Eastgoogle.</p>

			 <p>So, I contacted a company that produces in ear monitors three times over the last two years, with questions regarding their $400,- products, one of which I was considering to buy.</p>
<p>I never received an answer. Once I received an automated response, telling me that my email had reached them and that I would be contacted shortly, but the promised response never showed up and believe me, I checked my SPAM filter.</p>
<p>Yet today I received an email informing me of an <i>amazing offer</i> —to be honest, it is pretty good— even though I never signed up for any newsletters or requested promotional emails.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/how-the-editor-of-windows-magazine-became-an-apple-fanboy/">I don’t usually link to Cult of Mac, but this article merits an exception</a>. Mike Elgan, former editor of the Windows Magazine realises that he has —slowly but steadily— become an Apple fanboy.</p>

<p>Even though I resent the term and he clarifies that he means “satisfied Apple customer” by that in the end, it is a nicely written piece, showing just how rationally thinking persons can ‘fall’ for Apple products.</p>
<p>This is the money quote:
</p><blockquote><p>Other companies could do extraordinary things in the future. Apple could falter. If all that happens, I’ll be happy to switch again. I have no unreasonable loyalty to Apple. I’m just a satisfied customer.</p>
<p>But my story should be a cautionary tale for the entire industry. At this particular moment, Apple has struck upon a devastating strategy for taking control of the consumer electronics industry and mainstream computing: Build simple, elegant, functional and beautiful devices at all points in the consumer electronics chain. The cheap little devices like iPods and iPhones charm people, and build trust and affinity for Apple, predisposing them to choose Apple for the bigger-ticket items.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the <a href="http://angrymacbastards.blogspot.com/2011/07/episode-119-is-up.html" target="_blank">latest episode of Angry Mac Bastards</a>, John Welch, Darby Lines and their lovely guest <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/verso" target="_blank">Kelly Guimont</a> discussed an article from Business Insider, which cites UBS analyst Maynard Um titled <em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-apple-tv-2011-7" target="_blank">“If Apple Television Is Next, Then So Is A “Genius Squad,” Says UBS”</a></em>.<br/>(The fun starts at time index 01:04:20)</p>
<p>They pulled the story apart pretty thoroughly, but there were two things in the article that got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One newish idea from Um is that Apple will have to send out its geniuses to hook up Apple televisions in people’s homes. This would be another one of Apple’s competitive advantages, although Best Buy has a similar advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we envision of Genius Bar is similar to the Geek Squad, which is fairly well known in the US as Best Buy’s service department to facilitate technology adoption – television set installations, wireless router installations, repair services, content transfer from one PC to another, file backup, set-up services, general troubleshooting, tutorials, etc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to be clear: I don’t think Apple will or should build a TV, because this market is even more of a standard-resistant minefield than the cellphone business and the Apple TV seems to work fine for most people <em>and</em> helps Apple sell content.</p>
<p>Addressing Um’s two points —and talking entirely out of my ass here— this is what I think Apple would do:</p>
<ol><li>Build the device, the software and the packaging in a way that people won’t need help setting it up. In other words; make it idiot-proof.</li>
<li>Get contracts in place with their favourite logistics providers that will have the delivery guy(s) carry the thing into the customer’s sitting room and maybe even heave it onto a wall.</li>
</ol><p>The first thing is called intelligent design, which is something Apple seems to be really good at and the second thing is called outsourcing of non-integral tasks of the supply chain, something that Apple is also really good at.</p>

<p>They sport a few interesting concepts, like a cable loop to keep the phones securely in your ears and a micro porous filter on the back of each unit to compensate for the lack of roominess and three-dimensional sound experience, found in almost all ear canal phones.</p>
<p>I like the design and would love to give them a try, but I’m skeptical as to whether the sound justifies a price tag of £150,- (around €170,- or 240,-) ifor earphones with dynamic drivers.<br/>Great sounding, decent-looking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uzFhlpKIvM">balanced armature in ear monitors</a> can be bought for that for that amount of money.</p>

<p><strong>TRIGGER WARNING; RANT AHEAD</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I am fucking sorry that I was born 100% white. I’m sorry that I’m not PRIVILEGED enough to be born a Native American so that I can receive financial help to FURTHER MY EDUCATION. I’m sorry you damned racist bastards are so fucking stuck in the past that you forget the current generations have NOTHING to do with what was done to Native peoples HUNDREDS. OF. YEARS. AGO.</p>
<p>Do you KNOW why I struggle with hatred against Natives? ONE. REASON. ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS RACIST AND GIVES THINGS TO A CERTAIN RACE THAT, OH LOOK, <strong>I WASN’T BORN INTO</strong>. That is the only reason. You tell me to stop hating? Fuck you. Fuck you all to hell. Fuck you. Fuck you. <strong><big><big>FUCK YOU</big></big></strong>.</p>
<p>What happened has NOTHING to do with me. WHY AM I SUFFERING BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID MISTAKES MADE BY PEOPLE FROM HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO? DROP IT ALREADY. DROP IT AND I’LL DROP MY DAMNED HATE. I HATE THE TREATIES. I HATE NATIVES. I HATE THAT THEY ARE SPECIAL AND YOU HAND THEM EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>“Get good enough marks and you can have scholarships!”</p>
<p>Well thanks a fucking lot. I guess having a lowest mark of 94% in my LAST semester of high school wasn’t good enough. I guess my 99% in history wasn’t good enough. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, and to the friend that can’t even bother to fucking try and talk me through this and instead assumes I’m “taking my frustration out on Native people.” Fuck you too. I don’t even have a CHANCE to apply for SHIT from the government. They don’t have scholarships for students that are white anymore. There are programs ONLY for natives. Don’t tell me I don’t know anything. I’ve seen enough to know you guys are HANDED STUFF. MAYBE I DON’T FUCKING KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT I KNOW ENOUGH. Know what the government will give me? MAYBE two hundred bucks a month. IF I get a student loan. IF I am low income. IF IF IF. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IT. </p>
<p>Now I’m sobbing. If there are people that can’t fucking take my rants, forget about being my friend. I’m upset. I’m tired of working hard not to be rewarded. What the hell is the point of working so much if it won’t make a fucking difference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…I don’t even have words for what I’m feeling right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No worries, I’ve got this.</p>
<p>The reason you “struggle with hatred against natives” is because you have an irrational dislike (probably passed through your family) for a different group of people. The reason you rationalise it as something you feel because they get more help or rights than you is two-fold:</p>
<ol><li>You’re smart enough and educated enough to know that you’re in the wrong on this, so you’ve reached for something that will allow you to continue being a bigoted jerk anyway.</li>
<li>Your friends are smart enough and educated enough to know that you’re in the wrong on this, so you’ve reached for something that will allow you to con… oh, wait, this is actually the exact same reason.</li>
</ol><p>Speaking as a straight cis white man from, I can absolutely guarantee you that you’re wrong about getting financial aid. Without financial aid from my government and my college, I wouldn’t have gone to college. If you want to go to college, and you got the grades you say you did, you can go to college. Trust me on this one.</p>
<p>But let’s deal with the substance of your post, because… well, because it makes me furious. You feel like you’re being hosed, and I get that; I really do. It’s <em>terrible </em>that your people weren’t killed in probably the most massive genocide the world has ever seen. It’s <em>awful</em> that no one committed germ warfare against your ancestors, stole their land, marched them hundreds or thousands of miles, and gave them back a tiny bit of their own land to live on (along with widespread substance addiction). It totally sucks for you that your race isn’t used as a mascot by sports teams or used as a placeholder for “noble savagery” on dozens of TV shows every year.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m sorry that the American government doesn’t exist purely to make sure that you personally get free money, even though it did make sure that you got a world-class education. Hell, you even knew enough to use the word “privilege” as a barb. I’m impressed. But I’m not sympathetic. Look around you. You have everything you need to further your education already.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR version: The world doesn’t owe you a goddamned thing. Go work for it, and stop complaining that people who’ve been fucked over for generations have it worse than you.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m approaching the end of my time in university, studying Sinology and Business and this application has been of great help along the way.</p>
<p>Anybody who needs a reliable Chinese-English (English-Chinese) dictionary should try Pleco. It&#8217;s a universal application with tons of useful features in a well thought-out user interface. The entire application is modular, so you can add features to perfectly suit your needs. Their forums provide great support for anything Pleco-related and the staff is always open for suggestions and feature requests.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite features are:</p>
<ul><li>A highly customisable <a href="http://www.pleco.com/ipmanual/flashtut.html" target="_blank">flashcard</a> system.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7VTo0656Rc" target="_blank">Live-OCR</a> (Optical Character Recognition) for Chinese characters.</li>
<li>Full-screen handwriting recognition.</li>
<li>Stroke order diagrams (especially useful for long form characters).</li>
<li>And last but not least: Amazing dictionaries, some of which aren&#8217;t available in digital for anywhere else.</li>
</ul><p>The last thing I want to mention is, that they offer substantial student discounts.</p></p>

			 <p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/06/20/touchpad" target="_blank">Yesterday John Gruber wrote a short article about the imminent release of the HP TouchPad.</a></p>
<p>He argues that the <a href="http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/webos/us/en/tablets/touchpad.html" target="_blank">Touchpad</a> seems to be the most compelling iPad competitor so far, but HP will have to wage an uphill battle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the problem facing HP is summed up in the sub-head on this promotional page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The ultimate in entertainment with Beats Audio and Adobe Flash.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not a compelling answer to “Why should I buy this instead of an iPad?&#8221; I mean, who has even heard of “Beats Audio”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that the TouchPad will have to prove itself; a task not easily accomplished in a market dominated by the iPad. I don&#8217;t agree however with the assumption that the TouchPad has no differentiating features that would answer the above question.</p>
<p>Just like Apple had to tell consumers why the iPod/iPhone/iPad will make their lives easier, HP is going to have to educate consumers about what the TouchPad does and what it does that the iPad does not do. A consumer-centric feature like improved audio characteristics sound like a good argument to me, at the very least to grab people&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>A well-made series of commercials — let&#8217;s call it Apple-y — focusing on what the TouchPad can do for the potential buyer would be a good start.</p>

<p>There are two things, though, that I look forward to in the movie more than anything else:</p>
<ol><li>Witnessing Molly Weasley fight Bellatrix Lestrange in the great hall, because it was one of the greatest scenes in the entire series. The courage and determination she showed facing a witch as powerful as Bellatrix out of love for her children and the strength she projected was unequaled in the books.</li>
<li>Seeing more of Minerva McGonagall. She is by far my favourite character in the books and the essence of this character has been captured perfectly by Dame Maggie Smith. Any scene with her on screen instantly becomes a great scene.</li>

<p>My first thoughts when I heard about this seemingly done deal were the follwowing, in chronological order:</p>
</p><ul><li>&#8220;WTF?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>Snerk</em> They don&#8217;t even have to &#8220;improve&#8221; the interface.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lotta money.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Skype use some fancy encryption?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thought I had is best summed-up by Mr. Ihnatko:</p>
<blockquote>There’s also a hell of a lot of value in simply owning one of the world’s largest social-media networks. Skype users who are both (a) smart and (b) paranoid will now re-read their Skype terms-of-service agreement more carefully: Microsoft just bought a fairly comprehensive database of who knows whom all over the world.
<p>(I wouldn’t worry too much. Microsoft, unlike Google and Facebook, has yet to figure out how to monetize evil. It’s almost adorable.)</blockquote></p></p>

<p>What these close to fanatic RIM fans don&#8217;t understand is, the iPad desperately needs an actual competitor, because even a company like Apple can become complacent. Nothing spurs innovation like healthy competition.</p>
<p>By all means, I want the PlayBook to be good (and HP&#8217;s tablet, too), I want it to be all the things that RIM has been promising customers for months.</p>

<p>Hey Dan, I was just reading an interesting piece in that new iPad magazine. I think you’d really dig it.</p>
<p>Isn’t it amazing how it’s 2011 and we can just share these things quickly? Remember when you first used email and you were like, whoa dude, did you just send a <em>letter</em> to a possibly hot possibly girl in <em>Cambodia</em>? And you mean to tell me that she is going to be able to read it before I’m done saying this senten holy crap she wrote back already! Remember that? So since it’s 2011 this is going to be so much more amazing, yeah?</p>
<p>Alright, let me find this bad boy. For some reason* I can’t search this app so let me simply swipe my way through every page of every issue until I see the article I mentioned. I appreciate your patience. Ok here it is. Hey also for some reason* I can’t directly email this or select it to send it to you, so let’s do this right. You ready?</p>
<p>(*The pages are just dead images. There is no text to search or copy lol.)</p>
<p>Ok, download Futurio from the App Store. Got it? Love the sound of FREE, yeah. Take that, 1999. Ok, now, scroll on over to issue #9, the one with the poorly compressed JPEG on the cover, oh wait, now it looks better. Ok, buy (sike!) that one. It’ll take a few minutes to download. No, we can’t play Words With Friends while we wait, are you nuts. Hell yeah the download would break and probably be impossible to continue later.</p>
<p>Got it? Oh sorry, yeah, I’m eating a chicken confit sandwich. I had time to make it while the thing downloaded. Anyway, the article, the article… Right, it’s on page number, uh, well, ok it’s a big red page towards the back. Got it? Ok, it’s down at the end. No, scroll down. More. More. More. Ok there it is.</p>
<p>I know! I also thought Amanda would love it. You should totally send it to her.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, some people have a problem with Parsons’ “philanthropy,” and they’ve taken to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Bob+Parsons" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://youropenbook.org/?q=Bob+Parsons&gender=any" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and every other opinion-voicing medium to express their disapproval and disgust. “What the f*ck is wrong with you?,” filmmaker Eli Roth <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/eliroth/status/53199326356324352" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. “It’s sick f*cks like you that make me think <em>Hostel</em> could really happen.”</p>
<p>Others have taken more direct action: PETA named Parsons’ <a href="http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2011/03/29/go-daddy-ceo-named-scummiest-of-the-year.aspx?PageIndex=4" target="_blank">the Scummiest CEO of the Year</a>, while rival domain registrar Namecheap <a href="http://community.namecheap.com/blog/2011/03/30/elephants/" target="_blank">announced a special reduced transfer fee</a> of $4.99, with a $1 from each transfer to be donated to Save The Elephants.</p>
<p>Defending himself against accusations of heartlessness, <a href="http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2011/03/peta_awards_go_daddy_ceo_bob_p.php" target="_blank">Parsons wrote</a>, “I have the support of the people who really matter in this situation, the families of Zimbabwe — people who need help to survive.” However, while “problem elephants” <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict.cfm" target="_blank">are a real thing</a>, <em>Time</em>’s Ecocentric blog <a href="http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/03/30/shooting-an-elephantwhy-godaddys-ceo-was-wrong/" target="_blank">points out</a> that shooting them is an extreme last-resort after non-lethal solutions like “chili and tobacco-based deterrents” have failed.</p>
<p>Also, “white man’s burden” is rarely, if ever, a valid excuse for an annual hunting vacation.</p>

<p>Let me also point out that not only is this guy an asshole, but his company will f you in the butt. I got slapped with a $910 charge for going over my bandwidth with them a few years back. I transferred immediately. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a scumbag. If GoDaddy had any decency left, they’d fire him immediately.</p>
<p>It only strengthens my decision to change DNS registrars next week.</p></p>

<p>Mr. Dediu provides a passionless translation of RIM&#8217;s Co-CEO Jim Balsillie&#8217;s remarks during the announcement of their quarterly results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very sceptical of RIM&#8217;s approach. Reading between the lines, I gather from it, that RIM&#8217;s own OS is neither ready for deployment, nor capable to do what they need it to, in order to compete with Apple.</p>
<p>Their decision to emulate Android apps on it that aren&#8217;t optimised for tablet computers, is a bad short-term solution at best and shows their lack of commitment to their own platform.</p></p>

			 <p>This is one of these situations. I signed up for Pinboard.in, a bookmarking service, that’s hellishly fast, very flexible and most of all; simple.</p>
<p>I was looking for a service that allowes me to save and organise links on certain topics efficiently. I need to do a lot of web research for four different term papers and for my master’s thesis.<br/>The recent del.icio.us kerfuffle brought Pinboard.in to my attention again — I remembered having read about it a while back, but I didn’t know when and why.</p>
<p>It took me 10 minutes to get through the <a href="https://pinboard.in/features/" target="_blank">feature list</a> and the ‘<a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/" target="_blank">getting started</a>’ material to realise this is the service I’m looking for.<br/>It then took me five more minutes to sign up, paying the $9.25 for the service.</p>
<p>The bookmark archiving feature requires a subscription, which costs $25 per year and I will upgrade to an <a href="https://pinboard.in/upgrade/" target="_blank">archival account</a> soon.</p>
<p>Now, why would I want to hit myself with a shovel?</p>
<p>Well, while I was sifting through my old bookmarks in Safari today, deleting unnecessary old stuff, I found a bookmark with this title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very interesting new bookmark service ‘pinboard.in’ for currently $1.50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generously Pinboard.in reduces the price of the first year of the archival account by the the amount of the initial subscription fee, so I will not loose any money;</p>
<p><em>But OH MY GOD could that service have saved me time and work had I subscribed back then.</em></p>

<p>A very insightful discussion on the insanity that is the Apple/tech sphere that I can wholeheartedly recommend.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve completely stopped reading sites like Gizmodo, Apple Insider, MacRumours and the likes, simply because they provide nothing of value anymore; they just spew unsubstantiated bits of information at their readers.</p>
<p>On the other hand I really enjoy reading both <a href="http://www.macgasm.net/" target="_blank">macgasm</a> and <a href="http://loopinsight.com" target="_blank">The Loop</a>, because they provide well filtered and well written content on topics that I&#8217;m interested in. Sites like the aforementioned are a refreshing change from the incessant chatter that surrounds Apple.</p>
<p>A few of the other sites that I enjoy for the same reasons are <a href="http://www.asymco.com/" target="_blank">asymco.com</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">daringfireball.net</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com" target="_blank">arstechnica.com</a>, <a href="http://macworld.com" target="_blank">Macworld</a>, and <a href="http://www.macalope.com/" target="_blank">The Macalope</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and no one should go out of the house without the current episode of <a href="http://angrymacbastards.com" target="_blank">Angry Mac Bastards</a> on their iPhone/iPod, because they cut through the bullshit like a hot <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Bat'leth" target="_blank">bat&#8217;leth</a> through butter.</p></p>

<p>Von den Verkaufspreisen mal abgesehen, will Vodafone offensichtlich nicht viele iPhone 4s verkaufen, denn die Tarife sind fast noch lächerlicher als bei der Telekom:<br/><em><strong>200MB</strong></em> Hochgeschwindigkeitsdatenvolumen, danach Drosselung auf GPRS Geschwindigkeiten.</p>
<p>o2, welche zu ihrem alten innovativen Selbst zurückgefunden zu haben scheint, hat zwar noch (!) ein etwas schlechteres Netz als die beiden Großen, aber die Tarife sind deutlich aggressiver gestrickt.</p>
<p>Ich lehne mich jetzt mal aus dem Fenster und behaupte, dass in einigen Monaten o2 die größte Zahl an Vertragsneuabschlüssen mit iPhones aufweisen können wird.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/apples-iphone-probleme-die-grenzen-des-schweigens-1.976419">Die Sueddeutsche ignoriert Kritik genauso sehr wie Apple</a><p>In diesem Artikel wird eindrucksvoll dargestellt, dass die Redakteure der Süddeutschen weder technisches Verständnis besitzen, noch den Willen, die Inhalte einer Pressekonferenz von Apple korrekt wiederzugeben, solange es die Besucherzahlen der Seite hoch hält. Einige Beispiele im einzelnen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple verwandelt seine iPhone-Antennenprobleme in eine Marketing-Veranstaltung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bereits dieser Satz im Teaser geht an dem vorbei was in der Pressekonferenz bei Apple behandelt wurde. Nach allen vorliegenden Daten besteht ein Problem mit der Antenne, welches einen sehr kleinen Prozentsatz der Nutzer betrifft und von Apple untersucht wird.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So verlor sich die vielleicht einflussreichste Figur des Silicon Valley denn auch in Rechtfertigungsphrasen. Erklärung zur Fehlerursache: Keine. Stattdessen lautet die Botschaft: Auch andere Handy-Hersteller haben mit Antennenproblemen zu kämpfen, selbst Apple sei nicht perfekt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RF-Technologie ist kompliziert und jeder Hersteller hat damit zu kämpfen. Diese Demonstration halte ich aufgrund der einseitigen Berichterstattung in den Medien für gerechtfertigt.</p>
<p>Eingeständnisse zu geringfügig höheren Abbruchraten beim iPhone 4 werden in dem Artikel nicht erwähnt.</p>
<p>Andererseits hat Steve Jobs die Frage nach den potentiellen Auswirkungen einer außen liegenden Metal-Antenne auf die Empfangseigenschaften nicht adressiert und wurde dafür auch prompt <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2010/07/unanswered-questions-unearned-trust.ars" target="_blank">von John Siracusa gescholten</a>, zurecht.</p>
<p>Dies ist <em>berechtigte</em> Kritik von einer <em>technisch versierten</em> Person <em>ohne finanzielle Interessen</em>, nicht wie die Quellen die die Süddeutsche hier genutzt hat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wer den Perfektionisten Jobs kennt, der intern dafür bekannt ist, schon bei den kleinsten Problemen an die Decke kennt, kann sich das Zähneknirschen hinter dieser Aussage vorstellen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ad hominem, Spekulation, unnötig. Dies hat in einem solchen Artikel nichts zu suchen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 22 Tage hatte Apple geschwiegen, …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was Apple in dieser Zeit getan hat, wurde von Steve Jobs erklärt und von dem betreffenden Redakteur nicht erwähnt.</p>
<p>Alles in allem zeigt sich hier genau die Problematik, die der Apple-Chef in der Präsentation und der nachfolgenden Fragerunde angeschnitten hat:<br/>Selbst gestandene Presseorgane haben sich dazu hinreißen lassen, für Besucherzahlen aus einer Fliege einen Elefanten zu machen.<br/>Aus den USA ist dieses Problem schon länger bekannt, aber es ist schade, dass es auch hier in Deutschland Einzug hält. Dieser Artikel ist nur die Spitze des Eisbergs;<br/>ähnliches durfte ich auf der Seite der Zeit auch häufiger lesen, als ich wollte, und besonders hier hätte ich so schlechte Journalistische Arbeit nicht erwartet (Beispiele: <a href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2010-07/iad-apple-google-admob" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/mobil/2010-06/ios4-standortdaten-apple" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/mobil/2010-07/apple-iphone-rueckruf?page=1" target="_blank">3</a>).</p></p>

			 <p>Soeben habe ich der Telekom die Kündigung für meinen iPhone-Vertrag per Fax zugeschickt, mit folgendem Wortlaut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,<br/>mit diesem Schreiben kündige ich fristgerecht meinen noch bis zum 29. Oktober 2010 laufenden Mobilfunkvertrag im Tarif „Complete 120“.<br/>Der Grund für die Kündigung ist die veraltete und unflexible Tarifstruktur der Telekom, die sich nicht mit meinem Nutzungsverhalten vereinbaren lässt.<br/>Ich bitte um eine schriftliche Bestätigung der Kündigung an die oben angegebene Adresse.<br/>Außerdem beantrage ich die Löschung aller meiner personenbezogene Daten aus dem System der Telekom nach Ablauf des Vertrages und untersage die weitere gewerbliche Nutzung sowie die Weitergabe zu Marktforschungs- und Werbezwecken.<br/>Mit freundlichen Grüßen …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bin ja mal gespannt, wann ich den ersten Anruf bekomme und wann die Kündigungsbestätigung eintrifft.</p>
<p>Ich beiße mit dem Barkauf eines iPhone 4 in London in den sauren Apfel, aber mit den Tarifen anderer Anbieter — in meinem Fall o2 — lässt sich mittlerweile eine Menge Geld sparen. Auf zwei Jahre hinweg gerechnet, bewegen sich die Ersparnisse je nach Nutzungsverhalten zwischen €200,- und €400,-</p>
<p>Für all diejenigen, die nicht nach der Kündigungsanschrift der Telekom suchen möchten, steht sie hier als Referenz:</p>
<p><em>Telekom Deutschland GmbH</em><br/><em>Kundenservice</em><br/><em>53171 Bonn</em></p>
<p>Die Faxnummer lautet: <em>0800 330 100 9 </em></p>

			 <p>Soeben durfte ich erfahren, dass die Macher der <a href="http://www.zeit.de" target="_blank">Zeit</a> an einer digitalen Version der Wochenzeitung arbeiten, die kein Adobe DRM voraussetzt.</p>
<p>Bisher bietet die Zeit für Abonnenten eine digitale Version der jeweiligen Ausgabe im PDF-Format, sowie im ePub-Format an, letzteres Bedarf allerdings des Adobe Readers zur Betrachtung.</p>
<p>In Zukunft könnte man ganz einfach die ePub-Datei herunterladen und per iTunes in die iBooks-Applikation auf dem iPad und dem iPhone kopieren. Oder man könnte die Datei direkt im <a href="http://premium.zeit.de" target="_blank">Premiumbereich</a> der Zeit auf dem iPad/iPhone laden und in iBooks abspeichern.</p>
