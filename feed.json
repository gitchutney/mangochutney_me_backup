Both bags are well-made (the Restrap definitely taking the cake, though), check all the boxes of features she was looking for … <em>and both do not fit her at all.</em></p>\n<p>On the Chrome bag the strap is way too long, making it impossible to cinch it down around her hip (the waist is completely out of question). If she wanted to use that one, she&rsquo;d have to modify the strap and shorten it by about 20 cm.</p>\n<p>The Restrap can be cinched down to fit her hips at least but the way the straps attach to the body leave the top half of it always dangling and rocking, creating discomfort and instability. Oh and the padding of the hip belt is very oddly cut so it digs into her hips.</p>\n<p>The search continues and my hunch is that she&rsquo;ll have to work with the people from Wizard Works in the UK or someone else for something custom and expensive.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>For the record: Specialized Diverge Carbon &amp; E5 (aluminium), Cannondale Topstone Carbon &amp; Aluminium, Trek Domane aluminium (and that&rsquo;s not really a gravel bike), Liv Devote.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

Out of all the bikes in the market, only roughly 6 models were even worth considering[^1] and even on those the componentry was sometimes ill-conceived with bars that are too wide, brifters too large, really long cranks (think 170 mm), two instances where the seat post was too long to allow for any kind of proper seat height, and just strange saddles. \n\nThis time around she was trying to find a hip bag with \n\n- decent usable volume, \n- proper waterproofing,\n- an outside attachment point for a bottle or a rain jacket, \n- and optionally: the ability to attach it to the handlebars of the bicycle.\n\nWe've scoured the web to find something and in the end ordered a Chrome Doubletrack Bike Bar Bag (5 l, already discontinued) and a [Restrap Utility Hip Pack](https://eu.restrap.com/de/products/utility-hip-pack) (6 l). Both bags are well-made (the Restrap definitely taking the cake, though), check all the boxes of features she was looking for … *and both do not fit her at all.* \n\nOn the Chrome bag the strap is way too long, making it impossible to cinch it down around her hip (the waist is completely out of question). If she wanted to use that one, she'd have to modify the strap and shorten it by about 20 cm.\n\nThe Restrap can be cinched down to fit her hips at least but the way the straps attach to the body leave the top half of it always dangling and rocking, creating discomfort and instability. Oh and the padding of the hip belt is very oddly cut so it digs into her hips. \n\nThe search continues and my hunch is that she'll have to work with the people from Wizard Works in the UK or someone else for something custom and expensive.\n\n[^1]: For the record: Specialized Diverge Carbon & E5 (aluminium), Cannondale Topstone Carbon & Aluminium, Trek Domane aluminium (and that's not really a gravel bike), Liv Devote.\n",

It's become my go-to at home under hoodies and flannel shirts, when hiking, walking the dog, and cycling. \n\nI have three of these shirts now.\n\n## [Injinji Liner Crew Wool toe socks](https://www.injinji.com/liner-crew-merino-wool.html) \n\nThese things are amazing for layering. Plain and simple. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2024/20240202-l1000791.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\nI have a pair of Shimano SH-MW702 GoreTex shoes with a wide toe box for cold/foul weather cycling. Sadly even with thick wool socks, I sometimes got cold feet on longer rides once my feet have become properly sweaty once. \n\nThese liner socks have fixed that for me. Separating out my toes + the effects of layering other socks on top has been amazing. It's easier to pick the right combination of socks depending on the conditions I'm going to be riding in and I often opt for a thinner pair of wool socks on top of these liners and bring a thicker pair with me on longer rides in the cold in case I've misjudged the temperatures.\n",

I really liked these tires: they punch far above their weight and lasted a long time.</p>\n<p>The type of rubber I wanted to go with next needed to be lighter, faster, potentially narrower (for those all-important and marginal Aero Gains™) but still robust enough to survive excursions onto field and forest roads that I enjoy on my rides</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-mondo-2bliss-ready-t2t5/p/1000161296?color=1000161298-1000161296\">Specialized S-Works Mondo</a> piqued my interest when I saw the announcement and after reading a review on <a href=\"https://www.rennrad-news.de/news/s-works-mondo-rennrad-reifen-test/\">Rennrad News</a> and a first look on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-s-works-mondo-tires-and-romin-evo-pro-mirror-saddle/\">Bikerumor</a>, I decided to give them a try.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mounting\">Mounting</h2>\n<p>I bought the 700×28c version planning on running them with Schwalbe Aerothan tubes.

I really liked these tires: they punch far above their weight and lasted a long time.\n\nThe type of rubber I wanted to go with next needed to be lighter, faster, potentially narrower (for those all-important and marginal Aero Gains™) but still robust enough to survive excursions onto field and forest roads that I enjoy on my rides\n\nThe [Specialized S-Works Mondo](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-mondo-2bliss-ready-t2t5/p/1000161296?color=1000161298-1000161296) piqued my interest when I saw the announcement and after reading a review on [Rennrad News](https://www.rennrad-news.de/news/s-works-mondo-rennrad-reifen-test/) and a first look on [Bikerumor](https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-s-works-mondo-tires-and-romin-evo-pro-mirror-saddle/), I decided to give them a try. \n\n## Mounting \n\nI bought the 700×28c version planning on running them with Schwalbe Aerothan tubes.

I checked what I had laying around in terms of componentry, made a list of stuff I&rsquo;d need and got searching.<br>\nI have to admit that it did feel like sacrilege swapping all of those perfectly good old components but I&rsquo;m very happy with the result (and I&rsquo;m not giving them away, so if I ever decide to sell the bike again, I&rsquo;ll likely install them again).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>List of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>680 mm wide (25.4 mm clamp diametre) Reserve handlebars (new, stripped the logos)</li>\n<li>Higher stem (bought used)</li>\n<li>Spurcycle bell, black (new – none of my bikes feels complete without one)</li>\n<li>SRAM GX Eagle group + NX Eagle HG cassette (bought used)</li>\n<li>Rotor Aldhu cranks + Rotor oval 34t chainring (bought used and got it surprisingly cheap)</li>\n<li>Magura HS33 hydro rim brakes (new)</li>\n<li>Specialized Pizza Rack (bought used)</li>\n<li>DT Swiss rims (32 spokes, 19 mm internal width) with Shimano XT hubs front and rear (bought used, almost mint condition and got them for a really good price)</li>\n<li>Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700×38c (used) on Tubolito tubes (also used)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bike rides really well and with the very low gearing, lugging the doggy trailer up one of many hills in the area is quite doable.

All original parts were from Trek's in-house accessory brand (before Bontrager) and the groupset was full Shimano STX RC (including the wheels). \n\nI immediately fell in love with this bike and after I picked it up from the seller at Lake Constance, it was fitted with a pair of SKS Bluemels Long fenders and a period-appropriate rear rack.\n\nAfter riding it happily for a few months, I made some changes to my stable of bikes and with some inspiration from The Radavist and Bikepacking.com—typical cyclist, I know—I got it into my head that I could turn this into a retro mod that would be appropriate not only for really quick runs to the supermarket but also for day rides when I don't need one of my more performance-oriented bikes. I checked what I had laying around in terms of componentry, made a list of stuff I'd need and got searching.  \nI have to admit that it did feel like sacrilege swapping all of those perfectly good old components but I'm very happy with the result (and I'm not giving them away, so if I ever decide to sell the bike again, I'll likely install them again).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2022/6f3a087bc6.jpg\" alt=\"Retro-mod of a 1996 Trek MultiTrack rigid trekking MTB with a Croozer dog trailer attached. The bike and trailer are standing on a grassy path alongside a green field, in front of a slightly hazy mountain vista.\">\n\nList of changes:\n\n* 680 mm wide (25.4 mm clamp diametre) Reserve handlebars (new, stripped the logos)\n* Higher stem (bought used)\n* Spurcycle bell, black (new – none of my bikes feels complete without one)\n* SRAM GX Eagle group + NX Eagle HG cassette (bought used)\n* Rotor Aldhu cranks + Rotor oval 34t chainring (bought used and got it surprisingly cheap)\n* Magura HS33 hydro rim brakes (new)\n* Specialized Pizza Rack (bought used)\n* DT Swiss rims (32 spokes, 19 mm internal width) with Shimano XT hubs front and rear (bought used, almost mint condition and got them for a really good price)\n* Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700×38c (used) on Tubolito tubes (also used)\n\nThe bike rides really well and with the very low gearing, lugging the doggy trailer up one of many hills in the area is quite doable. The rims are excellent and braking performance with the HS33 is incredible.\n",

				"title": "Removing Harry Potter from my shelves because J.K. Rowling is a raging TERF",
				"content_html": "<p>Some time two weeks ago, yet another story of the Harry Potter author publicly supporting something hateful aimed at the transgender community was reported on. This finally had me grab all Harry Potter books from my shelves, put them in a cardboard box, tape the box shut and put it away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Mf9LHZH/0/49c32741/X4/i-Mf9LHZH-X4.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Closeup of a wooden bookshelf with the Harry Potter Books in visible in three languages, a Marauder's Map in front of the books, with two wand from the film franchise on top of it. To the right the Knight Bus from the movies in LEGO form and various other bits and pieces of merchandise on top of the books.\"></p>\n<p>The Harry Potter books have meant a lot to me. I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve read them or listened to the Stephen Fry-narrated audiobooks. Hell, the books became so familiar to me that I bought them in various languages to aid me in learning. The franchise has been a point of connection with a number of friends. References from and memes based on content from the books and movies will be forever burned into my brain.</p>\n<p>But over the past few years, I found it hard to look at the books without a painful pang, robbing me of the joy I typically felt when thinking of the stories. The author&rsquo;s decision to propagate transphobia has tainted my relationship with the Harry Potter books for a long time, and it was, in all honesty, mixed with a fair amount of shame because I didn&rsquo;t catch <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it\">the various bits of transphobic drivel in her Cormoran Strike novels</a>, at a time where I had believed myself to be more sensitive to those topics already.</p>\n<p>For the longest time, I didn&rsquo;t quite understand why that was, why I wasn&rsquo;t able to separate Rowling from Harry Potter, when I&rsquo;ve separated the art from the artist in other cases.

				"content_text": "Some time two weeks ago, yet another story of the Harry Potter author publicly supporting something hateful aimed at the transgender community was reported on. This finally had me grab all Harry Potter books from my shelves, put them in a cardboard box, tape the box shut and put it away. \n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Mf9LHZH/0/49c32741/X4/i-Mf9LHZH-X4.jpg \"Closeup of a wooden bookshelf with the Harry Potter Books in visible in three languages, a Marauder's Map in front of the books, with two wand from the film franchise on top of it. To the right the Knight Bus from the movies in LEGO form and various other bits and pieces of merchandise on top of the books.\")\n\nThe Harry Potter books have meant a lot to me. I don't know how many times I've read them or listened to the Stephen Fry-narrated audiobooks. Hell, the books became so familiar to me that I bought them in various languages to aid me in learning. The franchise has been a point of connection with a number of friends. References from and memes based on content from the books and movies will be forever burned into my brain. \n\nBut over the past few years, I found it hard to look at the books without a painful pang, robbing me of the joy I typically felt when thinking of the stories. The author's decision to propagate transphobia has tainted my relationship with the Harry Potter books for a long time, and it was, in all honesty, mixed with a fair amount of shame because I didn't catch [the various bits of transphobic drivel in her Cormoran Strike novels](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it), at a time where I had believed myself to be more sensitive to those topics already. \n\nFor the longest time, I didn't quite understand why that was, why I wasn't able to separate Rowling from Harry Potter, when I've separated the art from the artist in other cases. Now I believe I finally got it: \n\nJ.K. Rowling is intentionally, actively, violently transphobic. She uses her gigantic platform to propagate hate and props up others who want to see transgender people hurt and excluded from society. By all appearances she revels in spreading an ideology devoid of tolerance and humanity. \n\nThis, combined with how much I love(d) the Harry Potter franchise, is the reason why I can't continue to blissfully enjoy the books. With Rowling it's not accidental ignorance, it's her desire to cause pain and endanger transgender persons.\n\nI can't expect her to change her behaviour, to stop causing pain, but I can fill the space on the shelf with books from other authors.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-HG4gL3G/0/028076b6/X4/i-HG4gL3G-X4.jpg \"An almost empty wooden bookshelf save for three book by the author Mary Robinette Kowal from her Lady Astronaut series on the left.\")\n",

				"content_html": "<p>On Saturday, I managed to beat my <em>innerer Schweinehund</em> <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> to go out for a winter cold/bad weather ride. I had wanted to take Swift Wind on a route I&rsquo;ve ridden a number of times since moving to Freiburg, to finally see how it compared to my gravel bike with road tyres.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-GcjrdBJ/0/1d02da79/O/i-GcjrdBJ.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Strava map of ride on 2020.12.05\"></p>\n<p>It was a good ride for the most part and once again I felt the differences between a true road bike and a road rubber-equipped gravel bike when it comes to, well, riding on the road. The weather was grey, moody, a bit of rain came down, too, and the roads were wet and dirty. Back home Swift Wind looked as dirty as Battle Cat, if you replaced the dirt and mud the latter attracts cycling off road with grime from the street.</p>\n<p>This was also the first wet weather outing with the Mavic Kysrium Pro Exalith wheels and I came away impressed with the stopping power and modulation of the wheel set/brake pad combination. Yes, they still scream like a banshee when breaking but that&rsquo;s going to go away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-rDG5Fh7/0/a65b8b41/X5/i-rDG5Fh7-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Titanium road bike, dirty from the grime off wet roads and bike paths, stood up against a sign post. A dirt path next to the river Dreisam and the hills in the distance forming the backdrop.\"></p>\n<p>The more important take-away from the ride was the realisation that somehow my bikes still don&rsquo;t fit me perfectly. On all three of my bikes, road, gravel, CX-turned-commuter I start to get numb hands after a certain amount of time and on the two drop bar bikes my feet start to tingle on longer excursions, too.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting a proper bike fit for a while, even if it means that the bike fitters are going to tell me that my bikes are the wrong size. Still, it irks me because the road bike and the gravel bike were bought based on the fact they have a similar if not identical geometry to my correctly sized CX bike<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t feel stretched out on my bikes, I always feel in full control of the steed no matter the terrain, and generally, I&rsquo;m comfortable. Ah well.</p>\n<p>I called one of the bike shops in the area that offers bike fittings to ask a few questions and to set up an appointment. The person I spoke to told me that what I was likely going to need is a professional bike fit by one of their partners (which I had expected) but before I went that route, they asked which issues I had. After a brief description they advised me to try something else before a bike fit: a wider saddle.</p>\n<p>They said that many people use too narrow a saddle or one that isn&rsquo;t wide enough to support their sit bones properly in the preferred position they ride a particular bike in. Because of that, the nerves leading towards the feet are compressed on the one hand and on the other hand, in an effort to compensate the pressure on the butt, some people will put too much weight on the upper body and hands.</p>\n<p>That… sounded eerily close to how I felt I was behaving on my bicycles.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>I use two saddle models: A Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow in the 148 mm width with the carbon shell and rails, and a Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston in the 143 mm width. My sit bones are 123 mm apart, so 140+ mm should be the proper width, based on the manufacturers' and retailers' recommendations, and in the case of the Fabric, after trying the saddle in the shop for a good amount of time.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, I get sore hands and numb feet more slowly on the Specialized saddle. With the input I received from the bike fitter in the bike shop, I think this may be because the Elaston cushioning manages to compensate for a potentially too narrow saddle for a certain amount of time while cycling.<br>\nThis also fits with what I&rsquo;ve read doing additional research about the Power Arc saddles on the internet. Seemingly, due to the strong curvature of the saddle, width numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story and more than one person found a better fit sizing up.</p>\n<p>A 155 mm Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston is on its way to me and should arrive later this week. I&rsquo;m very curious to find out if this changes things for me.

				"content_text": "On Saturday, I managed to beat my _innerer Schweinehund_ [^1] to go out for a winter cold/bad weather ride. I had wanted to take Swift Wind on a route I've ridden a number of times since moving to Freiburg, to finally see how it compared to my gravel bike with road tyres.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-GcjrdBJ/0/1d02da79/O/i-GcjrdBJ.jpg \"Strava map of ride on 2020.12.05\")\n\nIt was a good ride for the most part and once again I felt the differences between a true road bike and a road rubber-equipped gravel bike when it comes to, well, riding on the road. The weather was grey, moody, a bit of rain came down, too, and the roads were wet and dirty. Back home Swift Wind looked as dirty as Battle Cat, if you replaced the dirt and mud the latter attracts cycling off road with grime from the street.\n\nThis was also the first wet weather outing with the Mavic Kysrium Pro Exalith wheels and I came away impressed with the stopping power and modulation of the wheel set/brake pad combination. Yes, they still scream like a banshee when breaking but that's going to go away.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-rDG5Fh7/0/a65b8b41/X5/i-rDG5Fh7-X5.jpg \"Titanium road bike, dirty from the grime off wet roads and bike paths, stood up against a sign post. A dirt path next to the river Dreisam and the hills in the distance forming the backdrop.\")\n\nThe more important take-away from the ride was the realisation that somehow my bikes still don't fit me perfectly. On all three of my bikes, road, gravel, CX-turned-commuter I start to get numb hands after a certain amount of time and on the two drop bar bikes my feet start to tingle on longer excursions, too.\n\nI've been thinking about getting a proper bike fit for a while, even if it means that the bike fitters are going to tell me that my bikes are the wrong size. Still, it irks me because the road bike and the gravel bike were bought based on the fact they have a similar if not identical geometry to my correctly sized CX bike[^2]. I don't feel stretched out on my bikes, I always feel in full control of the steed no matter the terrain, and generally, I'm comfortable. Ah well.\n\nI called one of the bike shops in the area that offers bike fittings to ask a few questions and to set up an appointment. The person I spoke to told me that what I was likely going to need is a professional bike fit by one of their partners (which I had expected) but before I went that route, they asked which issues I had. After a brief description they advised me to try something else before a bike fit: a wider saddle.\n\nThey said that many people use too narrow a saddle or one that isn't wide enough to support their sit bones properly in the preferred position they ride a particular bike in. Because of that, the nerves leading towards the feet are compressed on the one hand and on the other hand, in an effort to compensate the pressure on the butt, some people will put too much weight on the upper body and hands.\n\nThat… sounded eerily close to how I felt I was behaving on my bicycles.[^3]\n\nI use two saddle models: A Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow in the 148 mm width with the carbon shell and rails, and a Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston in the 143 mm width. My sit bones are 123 mm apart, so 140+ mm should be the proper width, based on the manufacturers' and retailers' recommendations, and in the case of the Fabric, after trying the saddle in the shop for a good amount of time.\n\nInterestingly enough, I get sore hands and numb feet more slowly on the Specialized saddle. With the input I received from the bike fitter in the bike shop, I think this may be because the Elaston cushioning manages to compensate for a potentially too narrow saddle for a certain amount of time while cycling.  \nThis also fits with what I've read doing additional research about the Power Arc saddles on the internet. Seemingly, due to the strong curvature of the saddle, width numbers don't tell the whole story and more than one person found a better fit sizing up.\n\nA 155 mm Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston is on its way to me and should arrive later this week. I'm very curious to find out if this changes things for me. It would be nice to get the fit dialled without a bike fit and at this point I'm not ruling out anything, neither too narrow a saddle, nor a completely wrong understanding of bike sizing, or even the fact that I have too many pounds on my ribs for the type of bike I'm trying to ride.\n\n\n[^1]: That's a German figure of speech that there's no elegant English translation for. Literally it means \"one's inner swine dog\" and the closest meaningful translation is \"one's weaker self\". Beating your \"innerer Schweinehund\" means \"to overcome one's weaker self\" but really, it lacks some of the pathos we Germans imbue this phrase with.\n[^2]: I had the CX bike fitted at the manufacturer (Canyon in Koblenz, Germany). They took detailed measurements of me and found that I fell between two sizes. I got to try a number of sizes of the same model and the smaller of the two recommended ones was too short, felt too twitchy. The larger of the two felt perfectly right under my butt. I even tried the next size up to be sure and that one was way too stretched out and unwieldy.\n[^3]: I've done my best to make sure the reach of my bikes is correct, the saddle is not too high, my cleats are set up the way they need to be, the saddle tilt is right, and the drop bars and levers are set up properly. I've watched numerous videos on the topic, read up about it, etc. I tried everything short of getting a professional bike fit.\n",

It’s done exactly what I had hoped it would when converting my bike from a 2× 11 to a 1×11 system. With a 32-tooth chainring up front, the 9–39 spread in the back gives me an ample gear range, an easy 0.82 gear ratio in the lowest gear, a reasonably fast 3.55 gear ratio in the highest gear, and fairly tight and even gear spacing, particularly in the higher gears.</p>\n<p>In fact, I’ve been so happy with this piece of kit that I bought an e*thirteen cassette for my city/commuter/road bike that has, up until recently, sported a full SRAM NX Eagle group with a 11–50 cassette and a 32-tooth chainring.

Apple removed the headphone jack from its iPhone and iPads and replaced it with an easy-to-lose USD 9.— dongle <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage\">and they called it courage</a>. My feelings about the dongle went from a solid <strong>meh</strong>  (<em>#donglelyfe</em>) to loving these little things, seriously loving them. The reason is simple: they have amazing sound quality.</p>\n<p>In more technical terms (<a href=\"https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/lightning-to-3-5mm-adapter-sound-quality/\">source 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/lightning-adapter-audio-quality.htm\">source 2</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The output source impedance measures &gt; 1Ω.</li>\n<li>Frequency response is close to perfectly flat.</li>\n<li>Harmonic distortion is almost nonexistent across various resistances (Ω).</li>\n<li>Dynamic range is on par with previous iPhone headphone jacks, which had great audio quality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In less technical terms it means that these little dongles can drive extremely sensitive earphones with no to absolutely minimal changes to the frequency response (their sound signature) on the one hand and can also power full-size headphones on the other hand.\nTo get this kind of flexibility and sound quality, you&rsquo;d typically have to buy and lug around a dedicated portable DAC.</p>\n<p>My earphones of choice are the <a href=\"https://campfireaudio.com/shop/andromeda/\">Campfire Audio Andromeda</a>, great sounding earphones that are very hard to drive properly. Sources with an output resistance of larger than 1Ω will quickly and negatively impact the sound signature, starting with reducing the bass response dramatically.</p>\n<p>Using Apple&rsquo;s dongles, they sound brilliant, same as they do on my MacBook Pro. I even use the USB-C dongle to listen to music on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 that I use for work a lot. Its 3.5 mm audio jack is … not good, to be polite. With a USB-A to USB-C adapter and the USB-C audio dongle (again <em>#donglelyfe</em>), I get perfect audio quality listening to losslessly compressed music.</p>\n<p>So no, Mr. Young, Apple does care about audio quality even on a consumer level. And what I use for proof are these tiny, easy-to-lose, beautifully sounding, flexible dongles.</p>\n",

The reason is simple: they have amazing sound quality.\n\nIn more technical terms ([source 1](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/lightning-to-3-5mm-adapter-sound-quality/), [source 2](https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/lightning-adapter-audio-quality.htm)):\n\n* The output source impedance measures > 1Ω.\n* Frequency response is close to perfectly flat.\n* Harmonic distortion is almost nonexistent across various resistances (Ω).\n* Dynamic range is on par with previous iPhone headphone jacks, which had great audio quality\n\nIn less technical terms it means that these little dongles can drive extremely sensitive earphones with no to absolutely minimal changes to the frequency response (their sound signature) on the one hand and can also power full-size headphones on the other hand.\nTo get this kind of flexibility and sound quality, you'd typically have to buy and lug around a dedicated portable DAC.\n\nMy earphones of choice are the [Campfire Audio Andromeda](https://campfireaudio.com/shop/andromeda/), great sounding earphones that are very hard to drive properly. Sources with an output resistance of larger than 1Ω will quickly and negatively impact the sound signature, starting with reducing the bass response dramatically.\n\nUsing Apple's dongles, they sound brilliant, same as they do on my MacBook Pro. I even use the USB-C dongle to listen to music on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 that I use for work a lot. Its 3.5 mm audio jack is … not good, to be polite. With a USB-A to USB-C adapter and the USB-C audio dongle (again _#donglelyfe_), I get perfect audio quality listening to losslessly compressed music.\n\nSo no, Mr. Young, Apple does care about audio quality even on a consumer level. And what I use for proof are these tiny, easy-to-lose, beautifully sounding, flexible dongles.\n",

I'm not entirely sure about the fact they're bringing back her love interest and I'm also not sure if I need another look back, I think I'd rather see Diana Prince/Wonder Woman kick ass in the present after the events of \"Justice League\".\n\n{{< youtube sfM7_JLk-84 >}}\n",

				"title": "The iPad is still being held back by its operating system and Apple isn't being straightforward about the why",
				"content_html": "<p>My colleague and friend Mike sent me a link to an <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/\">interview with Phil Schiller on c|net conducted by Roger Cheng</a>. The core part of the interview concerns the new 16&quot; MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple&rsquo;s butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller&rsquo;s answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, that&rsquo;s not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we&rsquo;ll go down that path.</p>\n<p>iPad benefits because we assume that you need to be able to do most everything with touch, and we don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that experience. Mac assumes you want to do most everything with a keyboard and mouse input. We don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that path. You can look at some of the other products that will try to go halfway between the two. They end up just compromising experiences. That&rsquo;s not good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a 12.9&quot; 3rd generation iPad Pro. It&rsquo;s a device that&rsquo;s as close to my teenage self&rsquo;s Star Trek P.A.D.D. dream as I could hope for. But what drove me to stop using iPads for a couple of years after the iPad Air 2 and what still bugs me, even in iPadOS, are the limitations Apple places on the software of the device and on the capabilities of third party software. The way Schiller frames the separation between iPads and Macs is based on the type of input and that, to me, misses the point.</p>\n<p>Let me put it this way.

				"content_text": "My colleague and friend Mike sent me a link to an [interview with Phil Schiller on c|net conducted by Roger Cheng](https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/). The core part of the interview concerns the new 16\" MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple's butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller's answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:\n\n> No, that's not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we'll go down that path.\n> \n> iPad benefits because we assume that you need to be able to do most everything with touch, and we don't have to trade off on that experience. Mac assumes you want to do most everything with a keyboard and mouse input. We don't have to trade off on that path. You can look at some of the other products that will try to go halfway between the two. They end up just compromising experiences. That's not good.\n\nI have a 12.9\" 3rd generation iPad Pro. It's a device that's as close to my teenage self's Star Trek P.A.D.D. dream as I could hope for. But what drove me to stop using iPads for a couple of years after the iPad Air 2 and what still bugs me, even in iPadOS, are the limitations Apple places on the software of the device and on the capabilities of third party software. The way Schiller frames the separation between iPads and Macs is based on the type of input and that, to me, misses the point.\n\nLet me put it this way. When I was shopping for a new tablet at the beginning of the year, the decision to go for the top-of-the-line iPad Pro instead of an infinitely more capable Surface Pro 6 came down to two things:\n\n1. I put a gigantic amount of faith and € 2,000+ in Apple, hoping they would come through and at least add support for external storage with the next major release, as had been speculated. Thankfully, iPadOS delivered.\n2. The quality of third party software on iOS (and macOS), particularly from indie developers and once you venture outside of the big name applications, is still completely unmatched on Windows and in all areas: touch-friendliness, UX and UI design, etc.\n\nOn this I agree with Schiller: it's important to have proper support for touch and proper support for mouse + keyboard in the devices you offer.  \nThe best example sits in front of me daily; my lovely Surface Pro 2. This is a full-fledged Windows PC with all of the potential you expect it to have but using the operating system and third party applications in touch mode is a compromise at best and impossible at worst (and don't even get me started on the schizophrenic nature of Windows 10 itself with a Settings app *and* the Control Panel app).  \nBut the above also goes to show that it's not a matter of the devices' form factor or input methods but a matter of having the operating system expose as much potential to the software running on it and enforcing a high standard of optimisation for the form factor and input methods.\n\nComparing a modern Surface Pro 7 to a current iPad Pro leaves me with this conclusion:\n\n**Windows 10 limits how comfortably I can accomplish my tasks but iPadOS still limits what tasks I can accomplish.**\n\nAnd this is what I continue to have issues with, this is the thing that drives me to pick up my MacBook Pro or my Surface Pro 2 for tasks as trivial as using some necessary extension in a browser like Brave [^1], *or* quickly converting a video file I created on my camera into a different format, *or* adding new music to the Music app on my iPad, *or* inspecting the code of my website right in the browser I'm using. Tasks that the iPad, as a device, is absolutely capable of but that iPadOS keeps me from doing.\n\n[^1]: I am fully aware of the fact that allowing extensions and other features common on Windows and macOS needs to be done carefully because of the security and privacy implications.

There are a number of options, but none of them have had particularly good reviews – at least not judging by what I was able to find.

				"content_text": "<p>I just cancelled my Amazon Prime membership.</p><p>As for so many other people, using Amazon's consumer facing services has started to leave a bad taste in my mouth, seeing how atrociously they treat warehouse staff, the negative impact their business has on the delivery drivers of various logistics companies, and the myriad of other small or large bad things this company is doing or is complicit in because it makes them money.</p><p>A few weeks ago I received an email telling me that the credit card Amazon had on file for Prime membership payments was no longer valid and to update the payment settings lest I want to lose my Prime benefits by 12 January 2019.<br>The holidays gave me some time to think about how many of Amazon's services I use daily and consciously and I found that it was too many. Ignoring Amazon services I use by proxy, like AWS servers, here goes:</p><ul><li>Amazon.de and Amazon Marketplace for shopping</li><li>Amazon Prime for fast shipping</li><li>Amazon Prime Video for streaming</li><li>Amazon Kindle for reading ebooks</li><li>Amazon's Audible for audio books.</li></ul><p>With cancelling my Amazon Prime membership, I'm losing access to Prime shipping and Prime Video. Since I've started reducing the amount of things I buy on or through Amazon about a year ago, the former isn't too much of a loss for me. When streaming through Amazon Prime, my partner and I have used her Prime account anyway, so there's no loss for me there, either, until she makes a decision regarding her Amazon Prime account. This could happen sooner rather than later because we use Netflix much more than Prime Video.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how easy it'll be eschewing shopping on Amazon.de entirely and choosing different online shops but I'm not worried about this. The more difficult task will be finding proper replacements for getting ebooks comfortably and finding a good ereader for them. Finding a replacement for Audible will be similarly difficult. And with the latter two there's also the problem of DRM for the things I've already bought on the platforms.</p>\n",

Leider sind viele Strecken auf Komoot eher für Mountainbikes ausgelegt und mit einem ungefederten CX-Rad kommt man da häufig weder gut rauf, noch gesund runter (selbst, wenn ich als Streckentyp &quot;Fahrrad mit Schotter&quot; angebe).</p>\n<p>Ich bastele mir also seit einiger Zeit so meine eigenen Touren und teile hier meine erste, fertige Tour. Sie verbringt viel Zeit auf Schotterpfaden, Waldautobahnen, in den Weinbergen, und unbefestigten Wegen im Wald. Außerdem gibt es am Anfang/Ende einen richtig hübschen Anstieg den Petrisberg hoch. Start- und Endpunkt ist das Restaurant &quot;Jahreszeiten&quot; am Turm Luxemburg, in dem ich immer wieder gerne einkehre.</p>\n<p>Viel Spaß!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.komoot.de/tour/51698725/embed?profile=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n",

The cufflinks of the abuser have the GOP's elephant on them.</p>\n<p>I think this is an amazing piece of political satire, absolute genius. I'm German, I live in Germany, I'm only indirectly affected by what happens over there but the proceedings of last week, which were hard to ignore even over here, had me speechless so many times.<br>\nTo me, it's inconceivable that the GOP props up a man for the highest judicial position in the country, who has had a number of credible accusations of sexual assault, and testimony of character leveled against him, that absolutely disqualifies him not just for the Supreme Court but for any position in the judicial system. And that doesn't even cover the frankly insane and disgraceful performance before the Judicial Committee which betrays a deep disdain for the rule of law, hatred towards women, and shows a complete lack of capacity for impartiality.</p>\n<p>It's sad that U.S. politics is at a point where the Republicans, who have long been a danger to the U.S.A., are now willing to risk the last shred of independence of the Supreme Court to push through their agenda of hate, misogyny, homophobia, and shameless pursuit of power over other people, all of it driven by nothing but greed.</p>\n<p>The fear that if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, the U.S. will deteriorate into an autocracy even faster, is very real and I sincerely hope that the people of the U.S. realise this and stand up before it is too late.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sidenote\">Side note:</h3>\n<p>This morning I read about an interesting case the Supreme Court is going to decide very soon: <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gamble-v-united-states/\">\"Gamble vs. US\"</a><br>\nSome people on Twitter argued that the true reason the GOP and Trump want to push Kavanaugh into a SCOTUS seat, is so he can rule on the above case.<br>\nAt its core, the lawsuit is about a weapon possessions charge and whether a defendant can be tried for the same charge by both state and federal authorities (so called \"double jeopardy\"). <a href=\"https://www.democraticunderground.com/100211211624\">Several people argue that</a> a decision to prevent state and federal authorities from prosecuting someone for the same crime, could mean that a federal pardon from Trump, might prevent state authorities from prosecuting a person and would thus minimise the pressure state prosecutors can put on defendants in cases linked to Trump.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When writing about gear, I typically try to limit myself to solutions for problems I faced, or some New Shiny™ that really piqued my interest. This is an exception. It's an ode to my favourite lens.</p>\n<p>Half a year after having started shooting with a Fujifilm X-E1 and the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM OIS kit lens, I was considering buying a lens with a wide aperture for greater creative freedom. I checked which focal length I used most often and at the time ~ 75% of the shots I kept were somewhere around 23 mm (~ 35 mm full-frame equivalent) leading me to buy the <a href=\"http://fujifilm-x.com/de/lenses/xf23mmf14-r/\">Fujifilm XF23mmF1.4 R</a>.</p>\n<p>I won't lose too many words about the overall quality of this lens. Many people have done so before me and most of them have a lot more experience with photography and gear than I do. The focal length is versatile, the build quality and the overall image quality are great. Placing the field of focus is easy, and considering the amount of glass that has to be moved, it focuses quickly enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-K2CCjSK/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/75b06aa1e8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I absolutely love about the 23/1.4, is the fact that it's so boring, so predictable, so utterly unspectacular. In other words, it's dependable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two characteristics that influence the dependability and predictability of the lens the most are sharpness and the way it makes out-of-focus areas look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharpness\">Sharpness</h3>\n<p>Even wide open, the lens renders sharp pictures across ~ 70% of the frame from the center. More importantly, though, this doesn't change based on the subject distance. I can shoot close-ups at ƒ/1.4 and be sure that the center of the frame is going to be tack sharp while anything behind it ends up an unrecognisable blur. When shooting landscapes in waining light at the widest aperture, I know that the result is still going to be good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-kCgZ4kc/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/3f9b6ce91c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"renderingoftheoutoffocusareas\">Rendering of the out-of-focus areas</h3>\n<p>Many great lenses can also be capricious at times, where the way the out-of-focus areas are rendered can vary wildly depending on the subject distance and aperture and lead to less than desirable results sometimes, like overly busy looking backgrounds. The XF23mmF1.4 R delivers absolutely consistent results that take a lot of guesswork out of taking pictures. I choose my subject, the distance and angle, and pick the aperture I want.<br>\nFurthermore, the progression from sharp to blurry moving from the in-focus subject to the background feels almost linear (depending on the composition). The same holds true for aperture changes from ƒ/1.4 to ƒ/8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-9FrSDM3/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/1dbdb7a73a.jpg\" alt=\"Mika's front paws\"></a></p>\n<p>If I could improve one aspect about the 23/1.4, it would be the addition of weather sealing. As one of the older optics in Fujifilm's line-up, it's not sealed against the elements.<br>\nUnfortunately the smaller, lighter, and weather-sealed XF23mmF2 R WR is no viable alternative. Its image quality is great but the rendering characteristics aren't nearly as predictable or dependable, making the lens less versatile.</p>\n<p>Even so, the XF23mmF1.4 R is the lens I would take to a deserted island with me, the glass I would choose if I had to go with one lens for the rest of my days.</p>\n",

Today's example:</p>\n<p>Logitech just announced a new keyboard with a dial, customizable through their software. It looks nice and solid—as Logitech hardware usually does—and it works on macOS and Windows.</p>\n\n{{< youtube qY-FmTQQhEk >}} \n\n<p>I read <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/31/16228168/logitech-craft-smart-keyboard-creative-dial-windows-mac-photoshop-mx-mouse\">the article on The Verge</a> and watched the video. All I could think of was how much this reminded me of the Sony Jog Dial™ built into my first own laptop, a 14\" Sony Vaio back in 2001.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/494560e969.jpg\" alt=\"Sony Jog Dial on a Vaio laptop.\"><br>\n<em>Image credit: <a href=\"http://itc.ua/articles/noutbuki_s_perednego_kraya_10197/\">ITCua</a></em></p>\n<p>It, too, was backed by drivers and a customization app. I loved this thing to death, having used it for everything from navigating the Start Menu, to controlling Winamp, to running system macros that took care of actions requiring a lot of tedious clicking.</p>\n<p>So yes, if the software is sufficiently easy to use and flexible and if the integrations with third party apps work well, this new Logitech keyboard will undoubtedly be a good tool. But it's really nothing new.</p>\n",

Leider habe ich weder die Zeit mich neben meinem Beruf darum zu kümmern, noch wüsste ich, wo ich konkret damit beginnen soll, denn ich finde mich in keiner Partei wieder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Die <strong>CDU/CSU</strong> steht außer Frage, denn der braune Partner der CDU lässt selbst die mildesten progressiven Ansätze direkt im Keim ersticken.</p>\n<p>Die <strong>SPD</strong> ist die CDU in schwarz-rot, gelenkt von verachtungswürdigen Menschen wie Sigmar Gabriel, der nachweislich lieber der Wirtschaft dient als deutschen Bürger*innen. Hierbei meine ich ganz konkret d<a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-09/spd-stimmt-mehrheitlich-fuer-ceta-abkommen/komplettansicht\">ie Abstimmung der SPD-Vollversammlung für CETA, die Gabriel durchgeboxt hat</a>. Ein undemokratischeres Handelsabkommen kann ich mir zwar vorstellen, aber CETA und TTIP kommen schon verdammt nah dran. Wirklich tragisch daran ist, dass ich <em>für</em> klar definierte und öffentlich verhandelte Freihandelsabkommen bin.</p>\n<p>Die <strong>Grünen</strong> wollen so sehr mitregieren, das sie bei der bloßen Andeutung der Chance auf eine Möglichkeit des Ansatzes einer Koalition jegliche Prinzipien über Bord werfen. Ihnen fehlen sowohl die Themen als auch klare Positionen zu Umwelt, Datenschutz, und sozialer Gerechtigkeit.</p>\n<p>Bei den Äußerungen von Vertretern der <strong>Linken</strong> läuft es mir eiskalt den Rücken runter. Diese Partei steckt voller Populisten und sie bewegt sich mittlerweile so weit links, dass sie wieder gut genug zu den Rechten passen, um demnächst mit dem \"progressiven\" Flügel der AfD zu fusionieren.</p>\n<p>Ach ja, die <strong>AfD</strong>. Diese Partei ist in kürzester Zeit von einer <em>NPD light</em> für den besorgten Bürger (= fremdenfeindlich, anti-sozial) zu einer <em>NPD 2.0</em> mutiert, die genauso wenig etwas in Deutschland verloren hat, wie die NPD, REP, und alle sonstigen blödsinnigen Gruppierungen ewig Gestriger (ich schaue euch an, Reichsbürger).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Wo soll ich mich also einsetzen? Wo soll ich im Herbst mein Kreuz setzen? Wie kann ich irgendeine Partei unterstützen, wenn diese nicht an Wahlversprechen gebunden ist?</p>\n<p>Vor diesem Dilemma stehe ich und viele meiner Freunde und ich sehe derzeit einfach keine Lösung.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My favourite camera strap by a long shot is the <a href=\"http://www.eddycam.com/de/shop/35mm/Edition-35mm-Schwarz-Schwarz.html\">Eddycam Edition \"35mm\" in all black</a>. It's comfortable, robust, and the design is understated. I bought it alongside my Fujifilm X-Pro2 last year and kept it on the camera since then.</p>\n<p>As much as I like this strap, there are two downsides to carrying my camera with a strap attached to the eyelets on either side of the body:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When using heavier lenses on the body, the camera becomes front-heavy, making it dangle uncomfortably when carried over the shoulder, around the neck, and diagonally across the body.</li>\n<li>I can't switch to using a wrist strap in those rare situations when I want to and wrapping the neck strap around my wrist is impractical and doesn't give me the secure feeling a wrist strap does.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a bit of searching for a quick-release solution to attach my Eddycam to, I ended up with the <a href=\"https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/anchor-links\">Peak Design Anchor Links</a>. I have a couple Peak Design camera accessories and straps and their quick connectors are second to none. The system is a bit bulky which was my one small, but ultimately unfounded, concern about pairing the Anchor Links with the Eddycam 35mm strap: it might've ruined the clean looks of the X-Pro2 + black Eddycam strap combination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/f30e2e4048.jpg\" alt=\"X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 01\"></p>\n<p>The big benefit of using a quick connector system like the Peak Design Anchor Links, is having a new option to carry my camera when attaching larger lenses like the <a href=\"http://fujifilm-x.com/de/lenses/xf16-55mmf28-r-lm-wr/\">XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR</a> zoom, or the <a href=\"http://fujifilm-x.com/en/lenses/xf90mmf2-r-lm-wr/\">XF90mmF2 R LM WR</a>. If I'm going to be using either of those lenses for a significant amount of time, I always attach the additional <a href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/accessories/camera_cases/#handgrip\">hand grip MHG-XPRO2</a> to my camera, which has a little gap on the right side of the base that is perfect for attaching one of the Anchor Disks — I'm honestly not sure if this is an intentional feature of the hand grip, but it's undeniably useful :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/260072880a.jpg\" alt=\"X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 02\"></p>\n<p>With the strap attached to one of the eyelets on the camera and the small gap in the hand grip, the camera will now hang vertically on my side, making the combination more stable and comfortable to carry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/0652626d4a.jpg\" alt=\"X-Pro2 + Eddycam + Peak Design 03\"></p>\n<p>I'm really happy with the result of this experiment and the increased versatility of this camera strap setup. The only thing missing now is an Eddycam wrist strap with an Anchor Link, as I don't find the Peak Design wrist strap very comfortable.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>May was a month full of snapshots and test shots.<br>\nA friend of mine lent me his Fujifilm X-Pro2 for testing. I was going to go to the south-west of France for a few weeks and despite wanting a X-T2, I couldn't get the X-Pro2 out of my head. After a week of putting it through its paces, it turned out to be a love at second sight situation. I bought the camera shortly after and <a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-wz2rXKn/A\">it's been my (daily) photography companion ever since</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-4b4LW6t/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/d2647628f1.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0041\"></a></p>\n<p>One of the things I really love about Fujifilm cameras are the film simulations — which is a fancy way of saying it has filters, just like Instagram :)<br>\nThe X-Pro2 added the black & white <em>Acros</em> film simulation and it was one of the things I was most curious about when I was testing the X-Pro2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-trZhTd8/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/d644fa431d.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0087\"></a></p>\n<p>Mika, our smaller dog, was a very patient test subject, at least when she was comfortably lying on the couch (below) or in the bean bag chair (above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-HkmNqzX/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/b506a34dfc.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0119 (Acros-G)\"></a></p>\n<p>The way Acros handles shadows and noisier sections of an image really is something. Of course, I did shoot a couple of pictures in colour, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-JNT6DZh/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/8644b7faf1.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0198 (Velvia, Schatten +1)\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-FHg5qz9/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/5061e4d3ff.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0210\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Snapshots/2016-05/i-F9pJBhW/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/5595db8afe.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0223\"></a></p>\n<p>The photo above is another one of those shots that just hammers home why the XF23mmF1.4 R is my favourite lens.

The Sony F707.</a></em></p>\n<p>I stumbled across this article while drinking my morning coffee and smiled all the way through.</p>\n<p>Back in 2001 I was working part-time at an electronics retailer in Mainz, Germany besides school. At that time, digital cameras were found in the computer department and not with film cameras.</p>\n<p>The F707 was a small marvel. It looked utterly alien for a camera even back then and boasted a few incredible features like proper infrared night vision that could either work on its own or a a focussing aid in almost complete darkness. It also had a <em>LASER</em> focussing system which was insanely cool and worked quite well.</p>\n<p>Back then, Sony reclaimed goods if they weren't sold in stores after a while and before that happened, they were usually offered to store employees at a heavy discount. I snagged the one remaining F707 we had in the store, making this not only my first digital camera but my first own camera, period.</p>\n<p>It holds a special place in my heart and the fact that it still works is just bonus.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've watched Batman v Superman a couples of times now. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It has some very serious problems with representing women that were hard to look past most of the time and made me cringe. Walking out of the cinema on premiere weekend—fittingly, the Metropolis in Frankfurt—discussing the movie with my sister, I felt that apart from aforementioned issue, something was off with the movie, that it felt like a bunch of snapshots of events put together, making it hard to find any sort of golden thread.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I stumbled across this interesting video review with an overly sensationalistic title, capturing this particular issue pretty well:</p>\n\n{{< youtube 38Cy_Qlh7VM >}} \n\n<p>All in all, it was an entertaining film and the extended edition is a bit better, in my opinion. The shortest and most accurate criticism came from the inimitable <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darth/\">@darth</a> on Twitter tonight:</p>\n\n{{< tweet 770462332749172736 >}} \n\n<p>Yes, Wonder Woman was severely underrepresented in the movie but what saved it for me was the feeling that in the few moments Wonder Woman was on screen, the writers, the director, and most importantly Gal Gadot managed to capture the core of the character. She's educated, smart, more experienced and more level-headed than Batman or Superman, strong, a formidable fighter, and a true warrior.</p>\n<p>There was a scene in the fight against Doomsday, where she was thrown back by a mighty blow of the creature but catching herself, the look on her face showed determination and the joy of battle.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of one of my favourite moments in DC's New 52 run when Superman and Wonder Woman became a couple. Batman was explaining his misgivings about their relationship to Superman by showing Supes a number of boxes stored in a secure corner of the Bat Cave. Each of these boxes contained countermeasures for each member of the Justice League, should they ever go rogue. The only one he didn't have a countermeasure for, was Wonder Woman. He deemed her so powerful that the only way to stop her, if turned evil, would be Superman.</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope that the 2017 Wonder Woman and the Justice League movies capture all facets of the character; the grace, the wisdom, the unshakeable belief in doing the right thing, the knowledge that sacrifices are sometimes necessary in battle, and not just the looks and fighting skills. The ComicCon trailer does look promising:</p>\n\n{{< youtube 5lGoQhFb4NM >}} \n\n<p>Bonus: \"Everything Wrong With <strong>Batman v Superman</strong>\"</p>\n\n{{< youtube X5tSpgU96WY >}} \n",

When the woman died unexpectedly and no one in her family would take Bijou in, she ended up in the animal shelter in Trier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/a43527130d.jpg\" alt=\"Bijou, the day she moved in with us, completely exhausted\"> <em>The day she moved in with us, completely exhausted</em></p>\n<p>The first few months after the adoption haven't been without issues, what with the surprise that the spayed dog we picked up going into heat about a week after she moved in with us, the discovery that the reason for some of her crooked claws is a <a href=\"http://www.vetbook.org/wiki/dog/index.php?title=Lupoid_onychodystrophy\">genetic disorder</a> which thankfully hasn't resurfaced again, so far, and the surgery she had to go through in December 2015 to have her spleen removed because her vet discovered growing masses in it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/96260c03eb.jpg\" alt=\"Bijou in a children's dinosaur onesie after her spleen removal surgery\"> <em>Bijou after her spleen removal surgery, in a children's dinosaur onesie that we got her in lieu of an Elizabethan collar</em></p>\n<p>The good thing is that Bijou didn't mind the frequent visits to the vet and quickly became the staff favourite at the clinic because she was so incredibly relaxed, never showing even the smallest signs of aggression during the examinations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/c033fd6ba4.jpg\" alt=\"Relaxing after a long day at the beach in the Netherlands\"> <em>Relaxing after a long day at the beach in the Netherlands</em></p>\n<p>The way she behaved towards the staff of the veterinary clinic was the first indicator that had found an incredible dog. She also has little to no hunting instinct which, on a few occasions, made for fun encounters with cats, foxes, deer, horses, and cows. Especially deer were surprised not to be chased or barked at, to the point of coming closer to us during a few walks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, she's a walking food vacuum and loves to try anything and everything as long as it smells tasty. I do consider this a positive, though, because we can get her to do all sorts of things for food.</p>\n\n{{< vimeo 180356793 >}} \n\n*First attempt at teaching Bijou a patience trick*\n<p>I grew up around dogs and have met all sorts. I can say without a doubt that I've never met a dog as relaxed as Bijou. She seems to be utterly and completely unflappable. We were particularly happy to see that all she needs to accept a new environment or situation, is seeing me and my girlfriend being at ease.</p>\n<p>She's a bit protective towards us when it comes to other dogs and we found out that she seemingly never learned to play the way dogs usually do. She never reacts aggressively towards playful dogs, though, and she is quick to accept anyone that we consider a part of the pack. Like Mika, a dog from a family member that we had the pleasure of caring for for a few months while they were recuperating from a knee injury.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/b4432e9f45.jpg\" alt=\"Bijou, Mika, and I napping in the bean bag chair\"> <em>Bijou, Mika, and I napping in the bean bag chair</em></p>\n<p>One thing Bijou never understood, though, is Mika's obsession with digging in the ground hunting rodents:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/2fcd916424.jpg\" alt=\"\"Mika's digging again, isn't she?\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/feaeed07a7.jpg\" alt=\"\"Yup.

That's pretty much how I felt about any other movie shown in 3D.</p>\n<p>Until watching the 3D version of Ant-Man… which didn't suck.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because we had the choice to watch it in 2D (unlike in the cinema, where movies are often only shown in 3D for the first few weeks),<br>\nmaybe it was because the glasses LG has are actually more comfortable,<br>\nmaybe it was the fact that we were sitting in a space controlled by us without a bunch of strangers.</p>\n<p>It was an enjoyable experience and we'll be attempting to confirm our hypothesis that 3D movies are best watched at home over the next few months.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've been looking for a fitness tracker for a while now. Ever since we got our dog back in August 2015 I've been seeing improvements to my fitness, because—DUH!—the little beast has to be taken for walks every day.<br>\nI wanted to build on these small improvements and decided to begin running more, again, go to the gym more, and try out high-intensity bodyweight training.</p>\n<p>In pursuing these activities, I quickly realised that the iPhone as my tool of choice for tracking steps, storeys climbed, heart rate, and calories burned would not be sufficient. One might think that the Apple Watch would've been a natural fit for me—seeing as I'm pretty comfortable in Apple's ecosystem—but I saw too many things wrong with it to be a good fitness tracker and watch replacement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of actual waterproofing</li>\n<li>Short battery life of only about a day</li>\n<li>No continuous heart rate tracking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fitness tracker I would buy had to be better than the Apple Watch in all those areas and make it easy for me to use the data outside of the manufacturer's ecosystem (which immediately ruled out products from FitBit who think it's ok to lock a user into a platform with the user's own data).</p>\n<p>I ended up with the Garmin vivosmart HR, a favourite of <a href=\"http://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2015/11/garmins-vivosmart-hr-reviewed-dont-buy-a-fitbit-before-considering-this-band/\">Ars Technica UK</a> and <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-fitness-tracker/\">The Wirecutter</a> and from the looks of it the current best-of-breed fitness tracker on the market. It ticked all the boxes for me, with a waterproof body specified for swimming, 5-day battery life, and continous heart rate tracking. Garmin's platform, albeit not too pretty, also allows for downloading of all running data and it integrates with Apple Health on my iPhone.</p>\n<p>It should've been the perfect device for me but intensively using it for a week taught me a few things about myself and my actual needs in a fitness tracking device which, in turn, brought the Apple Watch back into the equation.</p>\n<p><strong>Waterproofing</strong><br>\nI don't go swimming with it (I hate swimming), so as long as it can withstand my sweat and rain (I love running in the rain), that's enough for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Continous heart rate tracking</strong><br>\nThis sounds like a useful feature and I'm sure it has its merits but <em>continuous</em> doesn't actually mean <em>continous</em> for the Garmin (or any other product as I found out later) as it only takes snapshots of your heart rate in regular intervals and activates continous tracking only when it detects significant changes for a certain period of time. That's still quite useful, especially when you're into sleep tracking but I'm not, which brings me to…</p>\n<p><strong>Battery life</strong><br>\nI tried wearing the vivosmart HR during the night but found it too uncomfortable. There's a hump on the underside of the device that houses the optical heart rate sensor and—at least for me—it became a slight nuissance when sleeping. So, just like with my wrist watches, I took it off at night. And if I take it off at night, I might as well put it on a charger.</p>\n<p>Then there's the fact that wearing a fitness tracker and a wrist watch at the same time felt stupid. With the exception of a short period in my life, I've always worn a mechanical or automatic wrist watch and it became apparent that the three issues that ascribed to the Apple Watch were actually non-issues.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few weeks and my beloved <a href=\"http://traserh3watches.de/uhren/details/url/p6508-code-blue.html\">Traser P6508 Code Blue</a> met its untimely and watery demise during a business trip. It was my favourite watch by a long shot because it was the perfect, lightweight no-frills watch that was easy to read in any light condition.<br>\nI'll definitely get another Traser watch at some point and I own another really good wrist watch but for now I'll stick with the Apple Watch and see if it's as good a fit as I expect it to be.</p>\n<p>This experience and my first few days with the Apple Watch have made me appreciate the compromises Apple has made with the watch in terms of waterproofing, battery life, feature set, and build quality. They've built a smart watch that will satify 90% of all potential user once economies of scale and experience curve effects bring the price down a bit for the lower end models.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Brian Jones, a scientist whose photography work I admire, has written an <a href=\"http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2016/02/the-leica-experiment/\">article about his recent experiences using Leica cameras</a> again.</p>\n<p>It's a good read that paints a picture of a brand that is letting their well-earned reputation as one of the top manufacturers for photographic tools slip away due to overconfidence and scant regard for their customers.<br>\nThis is best examplified by the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem is, when it came time for the Monochrom to be serviced, I’ve not been able to get it back within anything close to a reasonable amount of time.  The Leica Monochrom camera has been undergoing service with Leica for literally six months now.  Say that with me… six months… SIX MONTHS!  Imagine you acquired or invested a substantial amount of money in a product that was supposed to return either 1) satisfaction from use or 2) return on investment as a tool by not only paying for itself, but also earning you income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As someone who has developed a serious interest in photography over the last two years, Leica cameras and optics fascinate me. The reputation the brand has and the undeniably great optics that are out there, really have me itching to buy a one of their camera and a lens or two.<br>\nUnfortunately reports like this—and I've been told similar things by other photographers—make me doubt that I will ever purchase a rangefinder camera of theirs.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I like Chucks. I used to love them but over the past two years I got fed-up with the quality and pricing of these shoes.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge I haven't changed anything about the way I wear them, I didn't gain weight, and I still rarely wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row; but whereas before I knew that a pair of Chucks would last me about 1.5 years, I've had pairs (low top and high top) that only held up a mere six months before they fell apart.<br>\nAdd to that the fact that a pair of high top Chucks sells for a ridiculous € 75.– in German retail stores (<a href=\"http://www.mangochutney.me/201347the-price-of-chucks/\">I wrote about this in detail two years ago</a>) while genuine high tops can be had for ~ € 16.– in Beijing (as I was able to see first-hand during a recent trip to China).</p>\n<p>These experiences have changed my attitude towards the brand and the product for the worse and caused me to actively look for more durable, comfortable, stylish, and less overpriced alternatives (… to add to my evoked set). There are a couple of sneaker companies out there that make really nice, high-quality sneakers and shoes (Pointer, Boxfresh, Nike, etc.) and over the past two years, I've bought shoes from all of them.</p>\n<p>About a week ago Converse/Nike introduced the first major update to this product line in nearly a century, resulting in the <a href=\"http://www.converse.com/s/converse/landing-chuckII\">Converse Chuck Taylor All Star II</a>.  I'm not a sneaker fan, so the initial news/hype about the new version completely passed me by and I only got wind of it when I walked past a sneaker shop in Bonn.</p>\n<p>A quick trip to the Converse website revealed the key features: a removable, well-cushioned Lunarlon sockliner (pretty comfortable Nike technology, if you ask me), a padded non-slip tongue that is held in place by two elastic bands, perforated micro suede lining, and Tencel® canvas on the outside, which, from experience, is more durable than cotton and regulates moisture more effectively.</p>\n<p>I'm having trouble remembering if there was every time when where there wasn't at least one pair of Chucks in my shoe rack. I always liked that you can combine them with pretty much anything, that they don't look to extravagant and they're  timeless shoes at this point. For this reason I decided to give the new version a chance.</p>\n<p>My initial impressions after wearing them in a shop in Trier are that the Lunarlon sockliner has the potential to be<em>a lot</em> more comfortable than the footbed of the old version, the canvas feels nice, and the overall workmanship seems to have seen significant improvements, too.<br>\nWhile I'm not sold on the perforated suede and the padded tongue and ankles, the shoes felt so good on my feet that I found myself standing outside the shop 15 minutes later with a box containing vivid blue high top Chucks in my hands:</p>\n<p>Time and wear will tell whether the overall quality and durability have been improved enough during the redesign, so I'll have an easier time convincing myself that paying € 80.– for a pair of Chucks isn't completely bonkers. Maybe I will even start keeping more than one pair in my shoe rack once again.</p>\n",

That article was over 1,200 words, and I found the keyboard to be natural and precise. I now prefer it over any keyboard I have ever used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm in the market for a new machine and when Apple announced the new MacBook in March, the new keyboard drew my interest. While I don't like typing on a touchscreen very much, I have no problems with flat but good keyboards. When I finally had the opportunity to try the keyboard, a few days after the MacBook was available in stores, it took me about 20 minutes of typing to realise that I wanted this keyboard in my Mac, yesterday.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, Apple seems to be using the new MacBook as a testbed not only for the concept of an ultra light laptop with just one port but also for this particular type of keyboard. Therefore, while a bit disappointing, it's not surprising that Apple didn't add the new keyboard to the MacBook Pro with Retina Display at the same time.</p>\n<p>I hope that Apple will soon equip the rest of its line-up with this new type of keyboard.</p>\n",

There are many interesting connections to be made here:</p>\n<p>One is Apple making clear that iOS can be a viable work platform and Apple is allowing users to remove unwanted distractions. This isn't something only consumers will be interested in but also corporations that deploy iOS devices, when factoring in the <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7026282\">potential bandwidth savings when using adblockers on mobile devices</a>. I think it makes a lot of sense in light of Apple's recently established cooperation with IBM and it might convince even more companies to deploy iOS devices (especially because these content-blocking extensions don't have to be limited to ads).</p>\n<p>I would also say that Apple sees the potential to improve users' browsing experience and privacy on iOS devices and it says something about Apple's regard, or lack thereof, for the state of advertisments on websites today.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/\">allowing ads</a> in iOS 9's new <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/#apps\">News app</a> sends a mixed message to content publishers. I'm sure more than one media and ad agency executive will interpret this as, \"If you want your readers to see ads and make money off of them, you should really take a look at our News app.\" or depending on your mindset even, \"That's a nice ad business you have there. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it.\"</p>\n<p>From my perspective as a consumer, I don't have much against what Apple is doing here, especially given Apple's history of trying—with an emphasis on <em>trying</em>—to improve ads on mobile devices with their <a href=\"http://advertising.apple.com\">iAds</a> product. The few times I saw iAds in apps and on sites, I found them a lot less annoying than everything else that is out there.<br>\nOf course, this will only hold true, if Apple not only mandates design standards for content in the upcoming News app but also for the way ads are presented to a reader.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I love shooting with my Fujifilm cameras.</p>\n<p>Of course, I'm neither a professional photographer nor an amateur with professional ambitions; I just enjoy it immensely. A big part of this are the cameras I use. I have a Fujifilm X-E1 and a X-T1 and it's a pleasure taking pictures with them.</p>\n<p>I started out with the 18-55 mm (27–82.5 mm equiv.) kit zoom, which is really good. Shooting with the <a href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/\">XF18-55</a>, I found out quickly that my preferred focal length was somewhere around 23 mm (35 mm equiv.), which caused me to shell out the money for the <a href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/\">XF23mmF1.4 R</a> only a couple of months after I bought the X-E1 and it's the lens that I shoot with most of the time.</p>\n<p>Recently, I became interested in experimenting with different focal lengths but didn't want to shell out the € 700 it costs to get a 15 mm equiv. lens on the Fujifilms, so I did a bit of research and quickly stumbled across a good number of old lenses that, while not as objectively great as many of Fujifilm's current offerings, would allow me to try and find out which focal lengths I really like using.</p>\n<p>The X-series cameras use an APS-sized sensor and thus have a crop factor of about 1.5, meaning that I have to multiply the focal length of any lens I put on the camera with 1.5 to find out the 35 mm equivalent focal length.<br>\nThis isn't much of a matter when it comes to optics like those used for portraits, but it makes it really hard to get the super-wide-angle feel.</p>\n<p>The solution was to use a focal length reducer, which can almost negate the crop factor of the sensor (meaning that a 20 mm lens won't be a 30 mm lens on an APS-sized sensor, but somewhere along the lines of a 21.6 mm focal length). I heard about this kind of piece of kit on Jonas Rask's site and the same article made me want to buy a Helios 44 lens. My last holiday took me to Hong Kong and one of the points on my agenda was to get the recently announced successor to the focal length reducer Jonas is using.</p>\n<p>Now, I can't say a lot about the optical quality of the <a href=\"http://www.zyopticslens.com/lensturboII.html\">Mitakon Lens Turbo II</a> and I suspect that it's still not as good as the original <a href=\"http://www.metabones.com/products/?c=speed-booster\">Metabones Speed Booster</a> (the product it is based on) but you know what? <strong>It's a ton of fun!</strong> I haven't noticed any major shortcomings and the build quality is really good, much better than I'd have expected for the price.</p>\n<p>The two lenses I use with the Lens Turbo II right now are a <a href=\"http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Helios-44\">Helios 44M-4 2/58</a>, an old Soviet lens with a very particular bokeh—as seen in the photo at the top of this article—and a <a href=\"http://www.photozone.de/pentax/142-tokina-rmc-17mm-f35-review--lab-test-report\">Tokina RMC II 17 mm ƒ/3.5</a> ultra wide-angle lens from Japan.</p>\n<p>I haven't had a proper chance to really put the Tokina lens through its paces, but the Helios has already seen some good use. Below are some more pictures I recently took with it during a walk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Fotoarchiv/2015/KW16-2015-Fotospaziergang-mit-/n-HqFLnr/i-bJs9b7K/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/4b69a669af.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden fence in the evening light\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Fotoarchiv/2015/KW16-2015-Fotospaziergang-mit-/n-HqFLnr/i-qLR5CCx/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/85d47e2377.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF5569\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aghoffmann.net/Fotoarchiv/2015/KW16-2015-Fotospaziergang-mit-/n-HqFLnr/i-wg27zrW/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/57c4c118b8.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF5563\"></a></p>\n",

				"title": "The lifecycle of iPhones with 64-bit processors",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>One of the nice things about using Apple devices, is that they receive major operating system updates for a longer period of time than smartphones and tablets running <em>Android</em> or <em>Windows Phone</em>. When buying an iPhone one can expect that it'll be served with the newest iOS for at least three or four years, as these charts by <a href=\"http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support\">Michael Degusta</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fidlee.com/android-support-vs-ios-support/\">Fidlee</a> nicely illustrate. While the majority of consumers purchase and upgrade smartphones alongside two-year contracts with their cell phone provider (unlike tablets), it's good to know that an iPhone will be usable and up-to-date even after a two year contract has run its course.</p>\n<p>Of course older iPhones aren't capable of making use of every new feature an iOS version jump provides and in many cases the phones will feel slower because the new OS requires more performance, as <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/ios-8-on-the-iphone-4s-performance-isnt-the-only-problem/\">this article by Andrew Cunningham at ars technica</a> shows. The iPhone 4 is not able to run iOS 8, and it's a safe bet that iOS 8 will be the last major update that the iPhone 4S is going to receive, pointing to a four year update lifecycle for the iPhone 4S as well. The iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c are basically the same phone and their CPUs are very similar to the ones in the previous iPhone generations, which means that they should receive updates for at least another two years if Apple doesn't change iOS in a way that requires more processing power than the 5 and 5c can deliver <em>without</em> becoming slow to the point of uselessness.</p>\n<p>When the iPhone 5s was released and subsequently <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review/\">reviewed by the incredibly smart folks at AnandTech</a>, we found out just how powerful the A7 processor with its 64-bit architecture really is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The A7 SoC is seriously impressive. Apple calls it a desktop-class SoC, but I'd rather refer to it as something capable of competing with the best Intel has to offer in this market. In many cases the A7's dual cores were competitive with Intel's recently announced Bay Trail SoC. Web browsing is ultimately where I noticed the A7's performance the most. As long as I was on a good internet connection, web pages just appeared after resolving DNS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the most interesting statement about the iPhone 5s's performance was made by Anand Lal Shimpi at the end of his review:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The A7's GPU performance is also insanely good - more than enough for anything you could possibly throw at the iPhone 5s today, and fast enough to help keep this device feeling quick for a while.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What Apple's silicon teams have been doing for these past couple of years has really started to pay off. From a CPU and GPU standpoint, the 5s is probably the most futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while - the 5s is as good a starting point as any.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air\">John Gruber of Daring Fireball pointed out</a> that the iPad Air with its A7 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip\">SoC</a> was faster than a 2010 MacBook Air in many benchmarks, pointing out the desktop-class performance that the iPad Air, the iPad mini with Retina Display, and the iPhone 5s offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/8559/iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus-preliminary-results\">Early benchmarks of the newly announced iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus suggest</a> that Apple has once again managed to significantly improve the system performance of the A8 over the A7. However, these gains are similar to the past year-over-year CPU/GPU upgrades from Apple and not the kind of jump we saw when Apple moved from the 32-bit architecture of the A6 to the 64-bit architecture of the A7. While there are other significant internal differences between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, like the improved GPU and the NFC hardware for Pay, the 64-bit architecture, the fact that the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 have the same amount of RAM (1 GB), and the Touch ID technology make these phone very similar in most other respects.</p>\n<p>I'm sure the next versions of iOS will introduce features that require a lot of processing power and it probably won't be long before we see apps and games that take full advantage of the CPU/GPU in 64-bit iOS devices.<br>\nStill, I wonder if the shift to the 64-bit architecture might mean that in four years, when iOS 11 is released, the negative performance impact on the iPhone 5s will be comparatively lower than the impact iOS 8 presently has on the iPhone 4S, possibly making the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus the first iPhones with an even longer lifecycle than the previous generations, more in line with what we've come to expect from OS X updates, where a <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2014/06/03/os-x-yosemite-system-requirements-compatible-macs-list/\">MacBook Pro from 2007 will still be able run OS X Yosemite</a> once it's released.</p>\n<p>My 2008 pre-unibody MacBook Pro, that I keep around as a backup machine, is still perfectly up-to-date and usable. I really wouldn't mind being able to use an iPhone 6 for longer than the three years I've been using my iPhone 4S, even though I know that Apple will surely release something new and exciting next year, and the year after that, and the year after that …</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Tim Cook was interviewed by Charlie Rose a few days ago. I stumbled across the first part of the interview on <em><a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/09/14/tim-cooks-charlie-rose-interview/\">The Loop</a></em> earlier today and was surprised that I was able to watch it on Hulu in Germany.</p>\n<p>A lot of what Tim Cook said was meant to promote Apple's products—which should surprise no one—but he was also very honest about Apple's goals and the things that make Apple the company that it is. Everything from Apple's product development philosophy, to their organisational structure, to the companies they regard as competition is in line with what everyone with a certain amount of knowledge about business and product development processes can observe.</p>\n<p>I was left with three thoughts after this interview:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Without any apparent hesitation Cook revealed much about the company's inner workings, it's hard to imagine getting this kind of candid information from any other C-level executive in the world. Frankly, I find it scary and impressive at the same time, because it demonstrates how sure Apple is that its corporate culture and its way of doing things is a unique competitive advantage.</li>\n<li>Very few things that were said during the interview are news to people observing the company and the markets it engages in. Then why, with all this information out in the open, do so-called (or self-titled) analysts get so much wrong about Apple all the time? Why do players in the same markets constantly underestimate Apple and run their collective mouthes off? It really boggles the mind.</li>\n<li>If I had to give an explanation as to why the company is as successful as it is and has been for a long time, it would be that in Apple's corporate culture the <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/smartwork/201004/vision-and-mission-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter\">standard management buzzwords of 'vision' and 'mission'</a> are substituted with an actual sense of purpose to make great products.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're at all interested in understanding the company a bit better and getting a glimpse at what we as customers can expect in the years to come, you should follow the link to <em><a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/09/14/tim-cooks-charlie-rose-interview/\">The Loop</a></em> and watch the interview.</p>\n",

				"title": "Goruck GR0 + f-stop Harney Pouch",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Two great tastes that taste great together.</p>\n<p>When I bought the <a href=\"http://www.goruck.com/en/gr0\">Goruck GR0</a>, I wanted a sturdy daypack with enough space for a (1, 2, 3) day trip. I figured that I would use it to carry my Fujifilm X-E1 as well, but didn't give much thought to how the camera would rest in the backpack. My solution for carrying the X-E1 in the GR0 looked like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/487de9f81a.jpg\" alt=\"LowePro wrapping cloth and string pouch\"></p>\n<p>A cushioned LowePro wrapping cloth and a simple cotton string pouch for the batteries, SD cards and a few other small items. This was bad for several reasons, but the most annoying one was my gear shifting positions in the backpack, forcing me to hunt for it when I wanted to retreive the camera or a fresh battery.</p>\n<p>I started looking for a different solution and stumbled across great ideas <a href=\"http://jonadair.co.uk/post/14235335817/goruck-gr1-as-a-camera-bag-part-ii\">like using the insert from a Bilingham Hadley Pro inside the GR0, as shown by Jon Adair</a>. Three things stopped me from going this route:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The insert for Billingham Hadley Pro is quite expensive in Europe/Germany, costing around € 80.-</li>\n<li>The insert would rest at the bottom of the pack, making efficient packing a bit harder when carrying more than the camera gear alone and potentially preventing quick access, too.</li>\n<li>The Hadley Pro insert is of little use outside my GR0.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I kept looking, trying out a few other camera pouches and inserts, like <a href=\"http://www.crumpler.eu/index.cfm?seite=photo&Banana-Bowl&productID=7863\">Crumpler's Banana Bowl</a> and solutions by LowePro and less well-known companies. The issues I had with the Banana Bowl were pretty much paradigmatic for all the other products I found and/or tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They were either to small with < 3.5 l or too big with > 5.5 l in volume and the outer measurements would've made it difficult to place them in the GR0.</li>\n<li>The materials used weren't particularly desirable (like the neoprene on the Banana Bowls).</li>\n<li>Very few had grips or attachment points for straps to use them as small camera bags outside the GR0.</li>\n<li>There was no way to easily fix these camera inserts in place in the GR0.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I had almost given up and started thinking about ways to modify a <a href=\"http://www.goruck.com/en/gr2-field-pocket\">Goruck GR2 Field Pocket</a> as a camera bag insert and even considered making my own padded Cordura 500 den, MOLLE webbing-equipped insert (I'm not completely inept with fabrics and a sewing machine).</p>\n<p>Then I stumbled across a company called <em>f-stop</em> and their <a href=\"http://shop.fstopgear.com/us/products/icu/micro-icu/small-micro-icu.html\">Micro Small ICU</a> (Internal Camera Unit). This company was entirely unknown to me but apparently they make really good gear, as <a href=\"http://www.packconfig.com/post/86601884738/review-f-stop-tilopa-bc-by-david-massey-tilopa\">reviews like this one</a> show. Scouring their site for measurements and volumes (because the above insert was still a bit too big for my needs) I found the <strong><a href=\"http://shop.fstopgear.com/us/products/dakota/pouches/harney-pouch.html\">Harney Pouch</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The dimensions (W × H × D) are 28 cm × 18 cm × 10 cm (11\" × 7.1\" × 3.9\") with a volume of about 5 l.<br>\nIt was a perfect fit for the GR0 (11.5\" × 17.5\" × 5.5\") or in fact any GR-series bag, because all of them are about 11.5\" wide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/a25c7cba2b.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, front\"></p>\n<p>The Harney Pouch's outer fabric is 330 den Double Ripstop Nylon, it has a foam-cushioned and customisable main compartment, and two smaller and flatter compartments on the front (for less bulky accessories like batteries, memory cards, lens caps, and straps). It also comes with a light and comfortable shoulder strap, enabling use as a standalone bag. The bottom is reinforced and coated with a non-slip rubber.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/f29351b87f.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch with shoulder strap\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/15a041fc97.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, bottom\"></p>\n<p>The real kicker however is the backside of the pouch. Originally meant as an accessory to one of f-stops other carrying systems, it has straps on the back that are compatible with MOLLE webbing:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/c3da4c4b2b.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, back 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/4735f75610.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, back 2\"></p>\n<p>It fits the GR0's internal MOLLE webbing almost perfectly. There are only two things to observe when attaching it to the GR0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The middle vertical strap on the Harney Pouch can't be used (it's not really a MOLLE solution), and</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/33064d4afb.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/7a898d4f28.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 2\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the best possible fit, the vertical strap should be pulled through the topmost horizontal row of webbing on the Harney Pouch first and then through the topmost horizontal row of the GR0's internal webbing. Like this:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/c2ff022a23.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 3\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/a022afb6d9.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 4\"></p>\n<p>Attaching the Harney Pouch the regular way (by pulling the vertical straps through the GR0's topmost horizontal row first) will result in gap at the top of the pack, which can't really be utilised.<br>\nThe method described above places the Harney Pouch perfectly at the top of the Goruck, making it very easily accessible while not wasting any space.</p>\n<p>Size-wise the Harney Pouch really hits a sweet spot for me. I'm a photography beginner and don't have much gear — I also don't plan to build up a massive arsenal of lenses and cameras. Here's what's inside the Harney Pouch:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/efb1c11430.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 1\"></p>\n<p>To the left there's the Fujifilm Fujinon XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS with the lens hood. The X-E1 rests in the middle, with the XF 23mm F1.4 R including the lens hood and an OP/TECH 'SLR Wrist Strap' attached. On the right there's the shoulder pad of my OP/TECH 'Utility Strap – Sling' (<a href=\"http://www.mangochutney.me/optech-camera-gear/\">which I reviewed here</a>), the charger for the X-E1's batteries and the charger cable.<br>\nIn the frontmost compartment I store spare batteries and the memory cards and the middle compartment houses parts of the OP/TECH strap and some accessories for it as well as a spare lens cleaning cloth.</p>\n<p>When I'm certain that I won't be using the camera during transit, I also store a rocket blower in the Harney Pouch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/5a07bdf800.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 2\"></p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, there's enough room in this camera bag to accomodate a mid-sized SLR with one additional lens or an even smaller mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (like the Sony Alpha 5000) with two additional lenses and some accessories.</p>\n<p>When attached to the GR0, it effectively eats about 1/3 of the usuable volume (5 of 21 available litres). It also makes the ruck rather top-heavy, causing it to collapse into itself when not fully packed. However, this isn't necessarily much of an issue: when trying to retreive something from the Harney Pouch while out and about, I usually stand the GR0 up straight, leaning it against one of my legs, or hoist it over one shoulder in front of my chest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/473edab354.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch in the empty Goruck GR0\"></p>\n<p>This is what the GR0 looks like when I'm going somewhere without my laptop:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/000773eaae.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch in the filled Goruck GR0\"></p>\n<p>For reference: Light waterproof jacket, 0.5 l stainless steel bottle, Tasmanian Tiger TacPouch (used as an organiser for smaller items), specs case for my sunglasses, and a specs case that I use for my earphones.</p>\n<p>If I take the laptop with me, it's stored in the appropriate compartment in the back while its accessories and backup hard drive are organised in a <a href=\"http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=61&product_id=154\">medium-sized Cocoon Grid-It! organiser</a> and stored in the main compartment. With all of the above already in the Goruck GR0, there's still enough space for some food and a light fleece sweater.</p>\n<p>In larger Goruck backpacks the volume of the Harney Pouch will have a comparatively smaller impact on the available space of the backpack. And if I really need the internal space of the GR0, I can also attach the Harney Pouch to the outside of the GR0.</p>\n<p>In conclusion I can say that it's hard to imagine a more fitting solution to carry my camera gear within the Goruck GR0 than the f-stop Harney Pouch. Inside the backpack it gives me quick access to my camera gear while staying out of the way when I pack my stuff. Outside the GR0 it is a sturdy, well-made, versatile, spacious (enough), and comfortable camera bag. Considering what it does, $ 75.- (I paid € 55.-) isn't too much to ask.</p>\n",

				"title": "A few thoughts about Windows 8 and the Surface Pro 3",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I use Apple devices most of the time, but in recent months I had to use Windows 8.1 as well, both for my thesis and my job. The way I'm using Windows 8.1 is in a virtual machine on my 2013 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. I also have a second MacBook Pro (an old one from 2008) that runs Windows 7 in Boot Camp).</p>\n<p>Windows 8 can be a great OS and an incredibly frustrating one to work with. The positives are that it feels very lightweight and lean compared to Windows 7 and Vista; it has a fairly small footprint in terms of storage requirements and resource consumption; it's fairly secure; I actually like the Start Screen, but then I also like Launchpad in OS X; the flat design is visually pleasing and well-implemented.</p>\n<p>The one thing that I can complain about, regularly drives me bonkers. It's a schizophrenic OS that doesn't really know what it wants to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't need touch screen-optimised gestures on a PC that doesn't have touch screen, they're hard to discover, hard to remember, and even harder to use with a mouse or a trackpad.</li>\n<li>I <strong>hate</strong> that there are settings that can only be made in one part of the UI, while others things still have to be set in the Control Panel. I have a high tolerance for this kind of stupidity, but there are enough people I know that get so frustrated by this, they're afraid of changing any setting.</li>\n<li>Oh and feature discoverability in general is pretty bad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've said this before and I'll say it again: Microsoft should've taken a page out of Apple's book and gone with Windows RT for tablets and Windows 8 for laptops and desktop PCs. Proper optimisation and strict UI requirements for Windows RT applications would've made this entire mess avoidable and would've benefitted not only the users but also Microsoft in the long run.<br>\nBut unfortunately the c-level at Microsoft was too timid to let go of the past and backwards compatibility, too afraid of what their partners and businesses would say.</p>\n<p>In Germany there's a word for what Microsoft was trying to accomplish with Windows 8: They tried to create an 'eierlegende Wollmilchsau'.<br>\nLoosely translated it means 'jack of all trades', strictly translated something like 'egg-laying wool-milk-pig', and we all know that those don't exist — or shouldn't exist, depending on your stance on genetic experimentation ;)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>The Surface Pro 3</em></p>\n<p>I'm actually excited about this device and I look forward to trying one. It won't get me to switch from my MacBook Pro with Retina Display and iPhone, but from everything I've seen and read so far, Microsoft managed to produce a device with exceptional build quality, listened to what users looked for in a Tablet PC, and improved on the already good Surface Pro 2.</p>\n<p>I had the chance to try the Surface Pro 2 a couple of times and found it to be the single most enjoyable Windows 8 tablet to date (my points of comparison are tablets by ASUS, ACER, and HP) and it set the bar very high for third-party manufacturers.</p>\n<p>I'd have no qualms recommending the Surface Pro 2 or the new Surface Pro 3 to someone who wants a Windows tablet. They're certainly better than anything by ASUS, ACER, HP, DELL, and the rest right now. The only exception to this is Lenovo; while they, too, produce a lot of crap, the Thinkpad T43x series of laptops and the Thinkpad X23x series of convertibles are genuinely good devices.</p>\n",

				"title": "Looking for good camera gear? Try OP/TECH.",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When I bought my first good camera a few months ago one of the big questions was how I wanted to carry and use it. Before the Fujifilm X-E1 I used a Panasonic DMC-LX3 and always carried it on a wrist strap. The X-E1 is substantially bigger and heavier and I wasn't sure whether to get a wrist strap as well, or rather a neck strap or one of those new-fangled sling straps.</p>\n<p>During my search I was introduced to many products by many companies: Crumpler, Gordy, BlackRapid, SunSniper, LowePro, Artisan & Artist, Joby, Clik Elite, Luma Labs, and many more.<br>\nThe raw utility, customisability, and the quality varied as heavily as the prices and the more expensive products usually weren't the best or nicest looking ones.<br>\nThe general consensus regarding neck and sling straps seemed to be, that tripod-mounted solutions came loose more often than one would expect and didn't inspire confidence.</p>\n<p>One company that was often mentioned in passing was OP/TECH, a U.S. company that has apparently been around for years. A few quick checks at the major online retailers revealed that its products were generally well-liked, sturdy, and reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity I purchased the <em><a href=\"http://optechusa.com/utility-strap-sling.html\">Utility Strap - Sling</a></em>, and the <em><a href=\"http://optechusa.com/slr-wrist-strap.html\">SLR Wrist Strap</a></em> from OP/TECH. (The price for both items and a few additional connectors was lower than the price of one BlackRapid sling strap.)</p>\n<p>At first I was a bit anxious because they use quick disconnects and like many people I've had the occasional bad experience with these kinds of connectors from other companies. These, however, seem to be exceptionally sturdy and well-made, locking in place with a satisfying <strong>CLICK</strong> and no wiggle room.</p>\n<p>It turns out that my anxiety was unwarranted. I've been using the two straps for about three months now, during hikes, walking around town, a few (business) trips and pretty much everywhere I took my camera to and at no point did I fear that the straps or the couplings would come loose on their own.</p>\n<p>I can't say that the OP/TECH gear is the nicest looking solution, but it's certainly the most versatile and functional I've seen (having tried products from BlackRapid and Crumpler in the meantime). I can quickly change between having the X-E1 dangling from my wrist, to having it on the sling strap, to attaching it to one of the shoulder pads of my Goruck GR0 using a spare OP/TECH connector and a carabiner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/d76aa1979d.jpg\" alt=\"X-E1 with OP/TECH Utility Strap and SLR Wrist Strap\"></p>\n",

				"title": "And I still don't like 3D movies",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Someone in the movie industry must still think that 3D movies are a good idea and I think this person needs to be told to take a step back, then another step back, a few more steps back, leave the building and never come back again.</p>\n<p>The most recent movie I watched in 3D was 'Captain America — The Winter Soldier'. Why did I watch it in 3D? Because it's not being shown in 2D and I wanted to see it in the cinema.<br>\nOr to put it another way: I was pretty much <strong>coerced</strong> into watching it in 3D because no cinema in the region shows the movie in 2D. To be <strike>allowed to pay to</strike> able to watch it in 2D, I was going to have to wait for the BluRay release.</p>\n<p>Tell me how that makes sense? The movie industry is essentially telling me that I will love 3D even if they have to force me love it.</p>\n<p>3D is nice in theory but there's only one movie I watched so far that did 3D \"right\" — in the sense that you can make 3D right and feel like something more than a novelty. That movie was 'The Hobbit'. It was filmed in 3D from start to finish and it's the only movie where 3D didn't feel like it was a tacked-on feature to get that badge on the movie poster.</p>\n<p>The Hobbit was also best case scenario for 3D. Here the feature felt like a fun addition that didn't make me enjoy the movie more, but it also didn't diminish the movie watching experience.</p>\n<p>Every other time that I watched a 3D movie in the cinema I was annoyed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by the stupid glasses which are uncomfortable and limit your viewing positions, thus making me tense up,</li>\n<li>because the 3D doesn't match with the filming style of the director and makes the movie feel hectic and all over the place,</li>\n<li>by the mediocre post-production 3D effects that look bad, have wrong perspectives, and unnatural depth of field effects,</li>\n<li>by the fact that the price mark-up for 3D movies is ridiculous,</li>\n<li>because the glasses are single-use and produce unnecessary waste.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that in mind I decided that I won't watch 3D movies anymore. I wanted to watch the second Captain America movie because it ties into the recent Marvel releases and I like what they are doing here in terms of the story. Still, I'm not going to watch the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie in 3D, even though it, too, ties into Marvel's larger storyline. Luckily the latter is not the case with the new Spider-Man movie and the new X-Men movie or Godzilla. I'm not going to go and watch them in the cinema if they're not being shown in 2D, or any other movie for that matter.</p>\n<p>So…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dear cinemas, movie distributors, movie publishers, movie studios, movie studio executives,</p>\n<p>I love going to the cinema. I love handing the cashier in the cinema my money. If the movie looks promising I even shell out the obscene € 10.- for some popcorn and a soft drink without hesitation.</p>\n<p>I won't, however, watch any more 3D movies. They're just not worth it.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n",

				"title": "My first impressions of the Nexus 7 and Android",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>For the past six years my primary computing devices have been iPhones, iPads and Apple computers. Five days ago I was given an ASUS Nexus 7 by my employer for testing purposes. Here are some of my first impressions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"thedevice\">The Device</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The form factor of the Nexus 7 feels strange. Having used iPhones and iPads for years a 16:9 screen feels alien for browsing the web and reading books and other written content.</li>\n<li>The build quality is good. To be honest I was surprised by this. It's not comparable to current Apple tablets or even the Microsoft Surface 2, but on the other hand the Nexus 7 costs a lot less. With the exception of the SIM card slot I'd equate the build quality and the perceived density of the device to an iPhone 3G.</li>\n<li>I'm not a fan of soft-touch coatings on devices and the Nexus 7 is no exception. They feel interesting for a while, but when they wear off the devices look crappy. Admittedly the coating on this tablet is among the best I've seen so far and I'll reserve my judgement for when it has been used a few months.</li>\n<li>The cameras, both front and back, are decent but nothing to write home about — which is perfectly fine for me as they only need to deliver good video quality for video calls and the occasional snapshot.</li>\n<li>The display itself is stunning; colours are great, viewing angles, too. Watching videos on it feels more natural than reading articles on the internet.</li>\n<li>The speakers are lousy, but at least the headphone port is decent.</li>\n<li>The buttons on the side are nice and firm and react precisely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"theoperatingsystem\">The Operating System</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>One thing I noticed immediately was that the interface is a bit laggy. This tablet is one of the fastest Android devices out there, yet iOS 7 on my iPad 2 from 2011 feels more responsive.</li>\n<li>The system (Android 4.4.2) is a bit overwhelming to be honest. The amount of customisablity—some, it seems, just for the sake of it—often has me second-guessing myself. I won't deny that Android is powerful, but it demands a lot from the user. The learning curve is very steep and I think that the average user won't ever scratch the surface of what it can do.</li>\n<li>The way Android approaches home screens and applications reminds me very much of Windows. Instead of a number of apps I have five small desktops that I can customise to a certain degree, but all my apps still reside in the applications menu (like the start menu). Another system I feel reminded of is my old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5\">Psion 5mx</a> running <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)\">EPOC32</a>, the precursor to Symbian.</li>\n<li>I'm not thrilled by the widgets. I already installed a good number of apps but with the exception of a few, widgets are rarely more useful than an icon with a badge. I have a good weather widget installed and the GMail widget, but most widgets seem to have been designed as an afterthought. Google's widgets show that there's potential, but I've seen nothing really compelling so far.</li>\n<li>The way notifications are handled is great. Same goes for quick access to core features of the device. Apple has nailed the latter with Control Center in iOS 7, but it's very clear that Android was the inspiration. Notifications are something that Apple definitely needs to work on, because right now it's neither here nor there.</li>\n<li>Having access to the filesystem has certain upsides but also a lot of downsides. Personally I like not having to deal with a filesystem in iOS, <em>but</em> it's great that on Android more than one app can access the same file without requiring me to move it between apps. Allowing an app to see, open and modify all files it's capable of opening on the entire device, is something I will need before I can truly start replacing my laptop with an iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"thesoftware\">The Software</h4>\n<p>There are very few applications I miss. The ones I do miss are pretty specialised apps that not many other people will find useful, but the most important ones all have fairly decent equivalents or acutal counterparts. The biggest drawback I see in most apps is that they don't integrate (well) with the third-party services I use (like Pinboard) but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RSS:</strong> On iOS I use <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder 2</a> syncing with <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. On Android I found <a href=\"http://twentyfivesquares.com/press/\">Press</a>. It's only a few bucks and possibly the best RSS reader on Android right now. It reminds me heavily of the old Reeder on the iPad and I really enjoy using it.</li>\n<li><strong>App.net:</strong> <a href=\"http://riposteapp.net\">Riposte</a> + <a href=\"http://\">Whisper</a> is what I use on iOS for ADN and ADN private messages, on Android <a href=\"https://www.robinapp.net\">Robin</a> is my app of choice at the moment. It looks great, makes even greater use of the tablet's screen (especially in landscape mode) and is very responsive. The only oddity is that I can't seem to filter out conversations as well as in Riposte.</li>\n<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Nothing beats <a href=\"http://twitterrific.com/ios\">Twitterrific</a> on iOS for me, on Android <a href=\"http://getfalcon.pro\">Falcon Pro</a> seems the way to go, even if setting it up is more than convoluted thanks to Twitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Movies:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.eplayworks.com/section/product/avPlayer.php?lang=en\">AVPlayer HD</a> might have a slightly odd interface, but has very meaningful gesture controls and deals well with different file formats. On Android the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html\">VLC beta</a> is the way to go for now.</li>\n<li><strong>Skype:</strong> I use the service very often and the Android app is not only a lot nicer than the iOS app, it's easier to use and more responsive. It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>\n<li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> Similar to Skype, the Dropbox app seems a lot more useful on Android than on iOS and the UI is much nicer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, these are my first impressions of the device and the software. In a few weeks I'll write some more, once I've really gotten to know both.</p>\n",

				"title": "A few thoughts about the Pono",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I'm very sceptical about the Pono.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/03/12/neil-youngs-pono-kickstarter-crushes-fundraising-goal/\">Dave Mark over at the Loop</a> wrote a short but thought-provoking piece about this new digital audio player, linking among other things to a <a href=\"http://routenote.com/blog/pono-music-is-the-worst-audio-player-i-have-ever-seen-steve-jobs-would-laugh-at-its-design-and-technology/\">pretty bad and overly negative piece</a> that didn't really address issues that go beyond taste and personal preference.</p>\n<p>The design is not an issue. To each his own. Even when Apple was crushing the DAP industry with the iPod, companies like Cowon and iRiver did their thing and still sold devices. The latter two and a few others gained a reputation for delivering great sound, better than the iPod's and that reputation was well-earned. Until the iPod Classic came around they definitely used the better audio chips, took more care in designing the circuit boards, which resulted in objectively better sound.</p>\n<p>Nowadays there are players like the HiFi-Man that not only do what the Pono can do already, but also cater directly to the kind of people that the Pono will try to win over. What's more—and that's something the Pono will have to prove—is that the HiFi-Man delivers enough power to drive big expensive and small and expensive headphones and in-ear monitors without the need for a separate amp.</p>\n<p>But where I'm really sceptical about the Pono (and the HiFi-Man for that matter), is that the audio files they can play, the fidelity they claim to offer, is nearly impossible to appreciate by humans.<br>\nBack when the Pono was first announced, Christopher \"Monty\" Montgomery of the XIPH.org Foundation (makers of the OGG codec) wrote a <a href=\"http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html\">great article</a> about the limits of human hearing and why to even the best ears, 24 bit/192 kHz music doesn't sound better than 16 bit/48 kHz.<br>\nIt's well worth a read to understand that whatever claims will be made about the device's audio quality prowess, is most likely going to be voodoo, misdirection and lies aimed at nothing but selling devices and music.</p>\n<p>Even worse, a possible debate what constitutes good audio quality might not revolve around <em>\"Having a good offering of losslessly encoded music would be amazing!\"</em> but <em>\"24/192 or death!\"</em>, akin to the megapixel race that brought us ever smaller digital cameras with small chips and big numbers that amounted to no better pictures than the generation before them — thankfully the photography industry has found its way out of this mess.<br>\nThis debate will be led by a small groupp of very loud people who listen to gear rather than music, who value the numbers and specs of the technology they listen with more than the what the technology was made for. To quote my friend Darby Lines: \"<a href=\"http://www.theangrydrunk.com/2013/05/08/nerds-ruin-everything/\">Nerds ruin everything</a>\". This breed of audiophiles <a href=\"http://www.the-ear.net/review-hardware/audioquest-ethernet-cables-pt2-ethernet-cable\">is deluding themselves</a> and has already created an industry around them that sells <strong>$ 1000.-</strong> ethernet cables for better audio quality — a digital connection, mind you.</p>\n<p>I love music. I'm also a fan of good audio gear. My home system is a well set-up Yamaha Pianocraft E400 and my mobile setup is my iPhone and a pair of <a href=\"http://www.westone.com/music/index.php/products/um-series/um-product-archive/um3x-rc.html\">Westone UM3X RC</a> with custom earmolds (frankly my favourite earphones so far; not the objectively best earphones I've ever had, but I simply love the tuning). I'm also a proponent of losslessly encoded music, because it sounds a lot better than what is being sold in the iTunes Store or on Amazon at the moment. But there are limits to what we can hear and I think that having Apple, Amazon and others offer FLAC or Apple Lossless files in their stores would be a greater step in the right direction than the Pono ever will be.</p>\n<p>(It would save me from having to still buy CDs among other things.)</p>\n",

				"title": "Shifting dates and times in Fujifilm RAF files",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A recent work trip brought me to a very beautiful region on this planet. This and the prospect of a few other nice trips this year led me to the decision to buy a new camera, since my Panasonic DMC-LX3 has started to show its age in terms of picture quality, compared to modern mirror-less interchangeable cameras and—believe it or not—my iPhone 4S.<br>\nI opted for a <em>Fujifilm X-E1</em> with the <em>Fujinon XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS</em> lens and I got a good deal for it, seeing that the X-E2 had just hit the market.</p>\n<p>Being still new to the camera—and admittedly not quite awake—I made a mistake when setting the date once I was in the destination timezone, resulting in the date stamps in the <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_Image_File_Format\">EXIF</a> data being off by -2 years and -6 hours in every picture. Of course I only noticed that once I sat in my home office again, while importing gigabytes of pictures into <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/aperture/\">Aperture</a>.<br>\nThis is where it started to go downhill, because while Aperture seems to do a fine job of processing the RAW file format Fujifilm uses, it doesn't have the ability to change the EXIF data of the files.</p>\n<p>After a lot of searching, the only viable solution turned out to be a command line application called <a href=\"http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\">exiftool</a> by Phil Harvey.<br>\nIt allows for <a href=\"http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/Shift.pdf\">date and time shifting</a> using an easy syntax — \"easy\" once you've stopped feeling intimidated by the prospect of using a command line application for a task like this.</p>\n<p><em>The following workaround has been done on a Mac, but since exiftool works on Windows, Linux and OS X this can be applied to other setups as well. On Windows there's actually a nice GUI application called <a href=\"http://www.geosetter.de\">Geosetter</a> that uses exiftool in the background, making the entire process even less intimidating.</em></p>\n<p>I initially thought I had to export everything from Aperture into a folder and then let loose exiftool on the exported files like a hungry hyena, but it was much easier than that. Seeing that each Aperture library file is a glorified folder, you can right click it in the Finder and select 'Show Package Contents' from the context menu. A folder will open, showing the contents of the library.<br>\nInside that folder the master files are kept in the folder 'masters' (Duh!), sorted into subfolders for years, months and (approximate) days and times.</p>\n<p>Now to the actual use of exiftool for my problem:<br>\nI wanted to change all date tags inside each photo (EXIF data contains more than one date tag and I wasn't sure which one Aperture would use or if it would get confused if it found two different dates in one file). As I had set the X-E1 to capture both a RAF file and a JPG at the same time, I needed it to change the JPG date and time stamps as well.</p>\n<p>After closing Aperture the first problem I faced when running exiftool on a few files was that it returned minor errors and warnings like this;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warning: Non-null bytes found in padding …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and subsequently didn't process files that returned errors.  I thought that there had to be some way to still process these files and a quick search for the warning turned up a forum thread and the maker of exiftool provided an <a href=\"http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,3961.msg18594.html#msg18594\">answer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As far as I can tell, the non-null bytes in the normally-empty section of the RAF image aren't referenced from anywhere, so I'm thinking that they are just garbage data.  I'll update the next version of ExifTool to make this a minor error, allowing the file to be written with the -m option.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The '<em>-m</em>' option you say? A quick look into the documentation revealed this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-m (-ignoreMinorErrors) Ignore minor errors and warnings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that in mind, here's what I did:<br>\nI opened a Terminal window and entere the command</p>\n<p><code>exiftool -AllDates+='2:0:0 6:0:0' -m /Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</code></p>\n<p>Here's what the command does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>exiftool</strong> launches the application.</li>\n<li><strong>-AllDates</strong> changes all dates tag within a picture.</li>\n<li><strong>+=</strong> tells the app that the adjustment will advance the dates into the future ('-=' would put them into the past).</li>\n<li><strong>'2:0:0 6:0:0'</strong> changes the date by '2years:0months:0days 6hours:0minutes:0seconds'.</li>\n<li><strong>/Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</strong> represents the location of my photos or a single file in the Aperture library package/folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cool thing about the way the Terminal works in OS X, is that you don't even have to type in the folder path manually — a source of many frustrating errors.  Instead you can drag the icon next to the title of the folder from the Finder window into the Terminal window and place it behind the command (don't forget the space between '-m' and the folder path).</p>\n<p>What resulted in the folder were .RAF and .JPG files with changed EXIF data and .RAF_original/.JPG_original files, the latter being the original files exiftool kept as a backup. I removed these files from the folder and put them in a backup location on my hard drive until I was sure that the new files not only had the right date, but were also intact.</p>\n<p>I started Aperture again, and after a few seconds it realised that the dates had changed and started to rearrange the files. Having changed quite a lot of files, it took a couple of minutes to re-process the photos, but afterwards everything looked great and all photos had the correct date and time associated with them.</p>\n<p>In summary this shouldn't have been necessary. Aperture—being the advanced application that it supposedly is—should be able to change date and times stamps as well as every other piece of EXIT and IPTC data I want it to change, because mistakes happen. Thankfully exiftool and similar applications exist, allowing users to make these changes and I'll be sending Phil Harvey some money because his work saved me a lot of headaches.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here's a condensed version of the workflow I used to change the date and time stamps in the EXIF data of my photos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Close Aperture.</li>\n<li>Open the Aperture library package/folder by right-clicking it in the finder and selecting 'Show Package Contents'.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the 'masters' folder and the subfolder holding the pictures that need EXIF data adjustments.</li>\n<li>Open a Terminal window and type the following command <code>exiftool -AllDates+='2:0:0 6:0:0' -m</code>. Add a space behind the '-m'.</li>\n<li>Drag the folder icon left of the title of the folder in the Finder window and drop it behind the command.</li>\n<li>Hit return on the keyboard and wait for exiftool to finish processing the files.</li>\n<li>Move the .JPG_original/.RAF_original/.XYZ_original files to a backup location outside the Aperture library package/folder until the successful adjustment has been confirmed.</li>\n<li>Launch Aperture, select the project in question and give Aperture some time to re-process the photos.</li>\n<li>If the desired changes have been applied correctly and Aperture doesn't show any errors or wrong EXIF information, delete the backup files.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Often I was greeted by a popover or sidebar badge that not only explained how to get notified about new content through Twitter or email newsletters, but also told me that there's a working RSS feed if I want to subscribe. Sometimes I was told plainly that just because Google Reader was going the way of the dodo, RSS wasn't about to stop working, usually followed by links to articles explaining how to add RSS feeds to popular browsers or email applications. (I noticed similar messages and announcements on a smaller scale when FeedBurner started acting up a few months ago, and many sites started to jump ship.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown\">Marco Arment wrote a good—albeit a bit over the top—article</a> about what RSS has to offer in a world where companies like Google, Facebook and increasingly Twitter are trying to lock users into their version of the web; an open, decentralised solution for spreading information that isn't owned or controlled by one person or company.</p>\n<p>It seems as if Google's axing of Google Reader reminded website owners and users of this fact, and that's a good thing.</p>\n",

				"title": "A few thoughts on Tumblr's acquisition by Yahoo! (and on the state of Squarespace)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>First off: I'm happy for the team behind Tumblr and I believe that it'll benefit the platform in the long run.</p><hr /><p>A little backstory for those who are interested in it:</p><p>When I first got serious about maintaining a personal site, I took a look at all the alternatives out there and decided to sign up with Tumblr. Previously I had used a site made with iWeb; it was nice, but not being able to add posts on my iOS devices got on my nerves quickly.</p><p>Tumblr was my home on the web for a long time, but at some point the limitations imposed on users became too much for me and I starting looking for alternatives. My search lead me to Squarespace, right when they transitioned from version 5 of their CMS to version 6.<br></p><p>At the time it was a good choice, because Squarespace offered;</p><ol><li>more customisation options than Tumblr,</li><li>the promise of good iOS applications,</li><li>and a clear company-customer relationship.</li></ol><p></p><p>Unfortunately Squarespace v6 has steadily gotten worse since I signed up. While I'm still their customer on paper, the changes that are made behind the scenes that directly impact the functionality and look of my site, without me having a say in them, speak a different language.</p><p>On this front, the only advantage I have over Tumblr is the lack of ads in my CMS (Squarepace's excellent support and <a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com/press/2012-11-1-fuel-buckets-keep-new-york-data-centre-live-through-the-hurricane\" target=\"_blank\">dedication to uptime</a> notwithstanding). Tumblr's iOS app is the best on the market right now, while Squarespace's app is slow, buggy, doesn't work well with v6, and often breaks things on the site when used.</p><p>And last but not least there's the fact that the only export format Squarespace offers today is Wordpress XML. The one thing I cannot stand when using paid services, are companies trying to lock me into their platform <strong>with my own content</strong>, when I'm already paying them.</p><p>At this point I'm on the verge of moving my site to a static site generation engine that's self-hosted on some dedicated server (most likely <a href=\"http://blog.getpelican.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pelican</a>). It would be a lot of work, but it would also mean that I'd have complete control over the site and wouldn't have to deal with crappy CMSs (one can add posts by uploading Markdown-formatted text files), making the site leaner as an added bonus.</p><hr /><p>Tumblr's acquisition has me perking up my ears. I might be willing/able to cancel my plans of going full-on neckbeard with my site (see above) and go back to Tumblr, if two things happen:</p><ol><li>Tumblr@Yahoo! introduced a true paid option that not only removes ads, but also makes it clear to them and to myself that I'm their customer, not advertisers or other third parties.</li><li>They reintroduce (in the paid plan if they want) simple options to import to, and export from Tumblr.</li></ol><p>I just want an easy way to write articles and post funny pictures, knowing that I own my content and can take it anywhere I want, if I want to.</p>\n",

				"title": "CinemaxX und die Abzocke mit Scheingebühren",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Gestern habe ich mit einigen Freunden im CinemaxX in Trier \"Iron Man 3\" geschaut. Trierer die diesen Eintrag lesen werden fragen wieso ich nicht ins <a href=\"http://broadway-trier.de\" target=\"_blank\">Broadway</a> gegangen bin? Nun, im Broadway läuft der Film leider nicht.</p><p>Der Film war unterhaltsam, aber mir wurde mal wieder sehr deutlich vor Augen geführt warum ich so ungern ins CinemaxX gehe:&nbsp;<em>Es ist alles darauf ausgelegt den Kunden abzuzocken.</em></p><p></p><p>Ich spreche hier noch nicht einmal von den völlig überhöhten Kartenpreisen an sich, nein, der Grund meiner Unzufriedenheit ist der Kartenkauf, bzw. die Kartenreservierung auf der Seite von CinemaxX:</p><p>Man kann entweder;</p><ul><li>Karten per Reservierungssystem vorbestellen, die man 30 Minuten vor Beginn des Filmes abholen muss, ohne Möglichkeit einen Sitzplatz auszuwählen: \"Sie erhalten automatisch die zum Zeitpunkt der Reservierung besten verfügbaren Plätze\". — <em>Das finde ich zwar nicht prickelnd, aber es ist in Ordnung, wenn man früh genug reserviert oder es einem egal ist wo man sitzt.</em></li><li>Karten telefonisch sitzplatzgenau reservieren. Das ganze funktioniert natürlich nur über eine kostenpflichtige Rufnummer und man zahlt einen Aufschlag pro Karte von € 0,50. — <em>Hier stellt sich für mich schon die Frage wieso ich einen Aufschlag zahle wenn ich ohnehin eine kostenpflichtige Rufnummer wählen muss. Wozu ist dieser Aufschlag da?&nbsp;</em></li><li>Karten direkt online zu kaufen. Hier kann man sich auch den Sitzplatz aussuchen, zahlt aber eine Vorverkaufsgebühr von € 0,50 pro Karte. — <em>Wieso eine Vorverkaufsgebühr? Der Kartenverkauf wird nicht von einem <a href=\"http://www.eintrittskarten-tickets.de/ticket-lexikon-vorverkaufsgebuehr-vvk-gebuehr/\" target=\"_blank\">externen Vorverkäufer</a> abgewickelt, sondern von CinemaxX selber, über deren bestehendes System. Habe ich irgendwelche Vorteile aus dem Kartenvorverkauf die außerordentlichen Kosten auf Seiten von CinemaxX gegenüberstehen? Sind die Karten im Vorverkauf günstiger als an der Abendkasse? Außerdem stellt sich mir jetzt die Frage ob ich bei Wunsch der Kartenrückgabe die&nbsp;<em>Vorverkaufsgebühr</em><a href=\"http://www.rechtslupe.de/steuerrecht/ust/refundierung-der-vorverkaufsgebuehr-beim-verkauf-von-konzertkarten-339699\">&nbsp;r</a><a href=\"http://www.rechtslupe.de/steuerrecht/ust/refundierung-der-vorverkaufsgebuehr-beim-verkauf-von-konzertkarten-339699\" target=\"_blank\">ückerstattet bekomme</a>? Aber nein, denn bei CinemaxX kann man gekaufte Karten ja gar nicht zurück geben. Wozu hier die&nbsp;</em><em><em>Vorverkaufsgebühr</em>?</em></li></ul><p>Mir drängt sich folgendes auf: Diese Aufschläge, Vorverkaufgebühren und ähnliche Preisspielereien sind nur dazu da die hohen Ticketpreise auf den ersten Blick ein wenig niedriger wirken zu lassen. Das kennt man von Reiseveranstaltern, Fluggesellschaften wie RyanAir und anderen Dienstleistern. Es wird dem Kunden vorgegaukelt, dass er einen Mehrwert erhält, der separat bezahlt werden muss, wenn da tatsächlich kein Mehrwert ist, der über die Grundleistung hinausgeht.&nbsp;Es ist nichts als eine <strong>Täuschung des Kunden</strong>.<br>Besonders da CinemaxX durch den Kartenvorverkauf online keine Kosten entstehen die über den grundlegenden Betrieb eines Reservierungssystems und einer Zahlungsabwicklung hinausgehen entstehen. Man kann mit Verlaub sagen, dass diese Systeme&nbsp;heutzutage&nbsp;zu den Grundkosten eines Kinos gehören. Außerdem&nbsp;spart es CinemaxX sogar Arbeit/Geld, da Kunden mit bereits gedruckten Karten (oder solchen die sie sich am Automaten im Kino abholen) nicht weiter abgefertigt werden müssen.</p><p>Bei der telefonischen Kartenreservierung frage ich mich was die Begründung für den \"Aufschlag\" ist. Mehraufwand durch telefonische Beratung? Ok, aber wieso dann die kostenpflichtige Rufnummer? Mehraufwand an der Kasse? Verursachen Kunden die regulär ohne Reservierung Karten kaufen weniger Aufwand? Oder solche die einfach ohne Sitzplatzvorauswahl Karten reserviert haben?</p><hr /><p>Meinem Unmut habe ich per Twitter ein wenig Luft gemacht, auch da ich weiß, dass CinemaxX ganz gut mit Kunden über diesen Dienst kommuniziert. Das ist der derzeitige Stand der Unterhaltung:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Es ist echt beeindruckend wie kundenunfreundlich @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cinemaxx\">cinemaxx</a> mittlerweile ist.

				"content_text": "<p>Today&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/galaxyonfire/posts/562504693771424\" target=\"_blank\">Fishlabs linked to</a> an interview with its CEO Michael Schade <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/9/4203206/galaxy-on-fire-alliances-is-a-way-to-expand-the-universe-and-appeal\" target=\"_blank\">on Polygon</a>.&nbsp;One of the topics was the question whether a developer can deliver a premium gaming experience with a Free-To-Play business model. Michael Schade seems to think so.</p><p>I think it's going to be a difficult task. Delivering a high quality game while at the same time trying recuperate the cost of development and marketing through a FTP model results in the creation of a <strong>thin red line</strong>.</p><p>On one side of this line players are going to enjoy the game but won't have much incentive to spend money. On the other side of the line players have no possibility to significantly advance in the game and enjoy it without spending money over and over again on&nbsp;In-App-Purchases (<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2013/02/27/real-racing-3-review-vastly-raising-the-graphical-bar-while-adding-loads-of-timers-and-iap/\">see the Real Racing 3 travesty of a game</a>).<br>Apply this logic to&nbsp;an online multiplayer game and that line becomes even thinner than in offline games, because it means a player (or a group of players) with sufficient funds can&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;gain so much power that other players will lose interest.</p><p>Walking that thin red line is what Fishlabs has chosen to do.</p><p>That being said, I believe that in previous <a href=\"http://galaxyonfire.com/en/galaxy-on-fire-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy on Fire</a> titles they've made good use of&nbsp;IAPs, limiting them to things that make the experience nicer, help the player progress a little bit faster, or give her/him a little edge, but nothing that'll completely alter the difficulty and thus the over-all experience of the game.<br>Because of this I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, but as we've seen with recent titles on the App Store, customers are increasingly sceptical of (high-profile) games that rely heavily on&nbsp;In-App-Purchases.</p><p>All that remains to be said is: \"Viel Erfolg Fishlabs!\"</p><p></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've loved wearing Chucks ever since my dad bought me my first pair of low top Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars in beige when I was seven years old.</p><p>The healthiness of wearing these shoes might be debatable; I've owned at least one pair for the last 15 years and my feet/knees/hips are very healthy. The quality of these shoes is also debatable, but I've learned over the years that if I don't wear them daily—which I rarely do with any shoe—a pair of high tops will last 1.5 years before they need to be replaced (e. g. fall apart).\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/applechutney/20153721888/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Converse Chuck Taylor All Star\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/20153721888_29e51f76b7_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" alt=\"Converse Chuck Taylor All Star\"></a></script></p>\n<p>All in all they're dependable shoes that I know what I'll get out of.</p><p>What I hate though is the price, or at least the markup this particular brand/model of shoes carries in Europe. To illustrate:</p><ul><li>I bought two pairs of high top Chucks in a sports store on&nbsp;<strong>NYC</strong>'s Time Square in 2009 for the regular price of ~ € 35,–</li><li>I bought the pair pictured above for € 42,– on the <strong>internet</strong> in 2011</li><li>A regular pair of high tops goes for breathtaking € 65,– to € 70,– in <strong>German retail stores</strong>, and—oh wonder—you won't find them cheaper in brick and mortar stores in almost any town in Germany. If you think collusion is in place here, you might be right.</li><li>During a few trips to eastern <strong>France</strong> in the last couple of years I've seen that they usually go for € 65,– to € 75,– over there as well.</li></ul><p>Why am I telling you all of this? Well, I lived in <strong>Beijing</strong>, China for a while and there I bought genuine high top Chuck Taylor All Star shoes for—hold on to your hats—a mere € 12,–. How do I know they were genuine? Well, I was able to compare the pair I had just worn out to the new one, and they were identical down to the last stitch.&nbsp;I approached the store owner and she told me that even at this price she makes a decent profit off of them.</p><p>I'm of course not saying that German retailers should offer them at Chinese retail prices, but think about this: even considering shipping costs and intermediaries the online retailer I bought a pair from three days ago (they'll arrive tomorrow) still gets a profit margin of over 200% out of them.</p><p>Certain types of brick and mortar stores are dying in Germany—shoe stores that don't perform well in six months usually disappear—but when I see a markup of 450% and more compared to what I paid in China and 50% to what I pay online, I don't see how I'll ever buy a pair of sneakers in a regular store ever again.</p><p></p>\n",

Jim's comment on the matter was the following:</p><blockquote>How can Google expect users to trust them with an app when they could shut it down at any time. No thanks Google.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I have more faith Google keeping Google Keep alive than Reader.&nbsp;From the data mining perspective it makes a lot of sense:<br>Reader gave them data on what you read, what sites you're interested in, but even this was a—potentially huge—haystack from which Google still had to pick the things you're really interested in, only slightly aided by the fact that you might've shared one or the other article using the buttons on Google Reader's web interface.</p><p>Google Keep will give them insight into the things that are important enough for you to have them saved permanently.&nbsp;It has the potential to give them data that's more useful than what they get from search, because you're doing the filtering and the only thing you save are the pertinent bits.&nbsp;It removes a huge amount of uncertainty for them.</p><p>Combined with data gathered through their search products and various social networks, Google not only knows what it is you're really interested in, but—in some cases—also how you came to acquire that information. After a while this'll make predicting your (re-)search behaviour and decision process a lot easier for them.</p><p>Last but not least there's the data from the real world that you input that Google might've had close to no access before. Users will be saving photographs of information they need to remember in there, maybe some documents and other random pieces of data that Google would've not seen before. All available for them to analyse and store.</p><p>What this means for Google is the ability to tell their customers that they have a more complete picture of the product (= you) they're buying.</p><hr />As an aside:<br>I've been an Evernote user for many years, since the first private beta actually, and even though the service has many problems and I've pretty much stopped using it, I was glad that it has always been a service that didn't rely on the company selling my data to make money.<p></p>\n",

This is the part that has been conveniently left out. A quick check of my own news feed revealed that four out of twenty entries were straightforward ads. I'm not even counting the ‘person xyz likes this company’ entries or sponsored posts.</p><p>I'm not complaining that <em>there are</em> ads on Facebook, after all Facebook is no charity and it's offering a service used by millions for the price of having our data sold to third parties so they can attempt to show us tailored ads.<br>What leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth is the way Facebook is sugarcoating these changes by omitting one of the most essential parts of the user experience. In the end ‘uncluttering’ the user's news feed from potentially irrelevant entries by your friends, will also mean that Facebook is going to have an easier time delivering ads in that same news feed that we users will have a harder time ignoring (or telling apart from actual entries by our friends).</p><p>The news feed redesign has received well-deserved praise <a href=\"http://davidchartier.com/we-do-not-own-our-audiences-attention/\" target=\"_blank\">from smart people</a> and I have to concur, it looks great and might solve a couple of basic problems the current iteration suffers from, but not showing one of the main aspects of the Facebook experience is disingenuous to say the least.</p>\n",

				"title": "Postbox, another non-alternative to Mail.app",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>… but it's not for a lack of trying.</p><p>A few weeks ago a friend of mine who had recently switched to a Mac, asked for help in finding a good email client, because Mail.app didn't feel right. The environment that friend is working in results in large numbers of emails that end up in his inbox every day and he has to send a lot of them, too.</p><p>He was coming from a perfectly customised installation of Thunderbird, that he'd been using for years without a hiccup. Due to <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/mozilla-scraps-thunderbird-development-email-client-not-a-priority-anymore-7000000469/\" data-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbird's state of developer support</a>, his employer is starting to prohibit its use and recommends moving to Outlook; so Thunderbird wasn't an option for the Mac. The application in question needs to handle Exchange, IMAP and two POP3 accounts (six in total).</p><p>Our first try was Outlook 2011 for the Mac, which proved easy to set up—especially the Exchange accounts—but overall less capable than the Windows equivalent, a bit buggy, poorly integrated with OS X, and in the end too much of a behemoth to be useful to him.</p><p>As I was a beta tester for <a href=\"http://postbox-inc.com\" data-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Postbox</a> before it hit version 1.0, I thought we should give it a try. The application is based on Thunderbird, uses the same underlying architecture for user data (e.g. profile folders, configuration files) and most Thunderbird extensions are compatible with Postbox. The application also uses an interesting approach to folders and attachments, which would've made it an even better fit than Thunderbird.<br>The lack of Exchange support was the first hurdle, but since his employer also provides IMAP access to emails it wasn't a deal breaker. Setting up the accounts was pretty easy (I used the same information that had been saved in Thunderbird) and migrating the POP3 inboxes to Postbox was equally painless (Thunderbird, Postbox and Mail.app all use the MBOX-format for storing emails).</p><p>But now the problems started:<br>Even though all IMAP accounts were protocol-compliant, Postbox wouldn't handle the folders properly. A lot of deleting and moving was necessary to make it a) see all the folder and b) load all messages within.<br>Next was a lack of support for the system dictionary and spellcheck routines. Postbox, just like Thunderbird, relies on user created dictionaries and translations, which often simply aren't good enough. With everything set up the app did it's work for about three days. Then for no apparent reason—no error messages popped up, the logs showed no changes or errors—Postbox wouldn't connect to <em>any</em> SMTP server. Receiving emails worked fine, but he couldn't send any. After reading loads of FAQs, support entries, troubleshooting guides and forum posts, I tried and failed to fix this by;</p><ol><li>Deleting and reentering all login data from Postbox.</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Postbox entirely and reimporting all data.</li><li>Deleting everything, reinstalling Postbox importing the original Thunderbird profile.</li><li>Setting up a new user on the machine and manually installing everything there.</li><li>Manually setting everything up on a mint system (I usually have a spare HDD lying around with a SuperDuper! clone of a mint OS X installation).</li><li>Checking if my router blocked certain ports (a long shot, since I use the same ports for my email accounts), but it also didn't work in his work network and Mail.app was still sending and receiving just fine with the same data.</li></ol><p>Nothing worked. It turned out that this is pretty much a known and unexplainable bug in the underlying architecture of Thunderbird and Postbox: For some reason at some point Thunderbird/Postbox refuses to connect to SMTP servers. Not one proposed fix worked and this isn't even limited to OS X; there are also reports of users on Windows Vista/7 having the same problem.<br>What pushed me/us over the edge was the lack of customer support for the developers of Postbox. If you're not a paying user who bought Postbox in a very specific time period (my old contact email didn't work), you cannot reach the devs through any means. This is what a desperate customer finds on their support pages:</p><blockquote>We have found that the best way to service Postbox customers is to help them, help themselves. In fact, 96% of Postbox users find the answer they're looking for right here on our Support Portal.</blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote>Please note that we do not offer one-on-one support offerings to new users at this time. All support efforts are currently dedicated towards providing better documentation and self-help solutions so that our users can more quickly find the answers they need.</blockquote><p>We were thankful that there's a 30 day trial period for the app and even more for the fact that the error cropped up before my friend had to buy the application. For a paid application—even if it's only $ 9.99—this is unacceptable.</p><p>In the end I helped him set-up Mail.app and tweak it to his liking. It might not be perfect and he misses one or another feature from Thunderbird, but it works.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Remember a few months ago when Tim Cook announced during an Apple keynote that the company would have something in stock for Mac Pro users in 2013? Well, today Mr. Cook announced in an interview that Apple is planning to produce an entire line of Mac computers in the USA. You can watch the video <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/rock-center/50095631\" data-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (link courtesy of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidcaolo/status/276665507455852544\" data-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Caolo</a>).</p><p>When asked how much a product like this would cost, Cook said that the price wasn't going to be an issue when producing over here, which is curious. He also said that it wasn't so much about bringing high tech manufacturing <em>back</em> to the U.S., but bringing it to the U.S. in the first place.</p><p>There are two things that came to mind when he said this:</p><p><strong>1.</strong><br>Cook is an operations mastermind and if anybody can make this happen in a way that is viable for Apple, I believe it's him.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><br>The computer I could see being manufactured in the U.S.A. is an updated Mac Pro line. The reasons are the following:<br><em>Firstly</em>, with these machines price really isn't much of an issue; the Mac Pro has been the most expensive product in Apple's line up for a long time. A price bump due to the higher production costs in the U.S. should be accepted more readily by customers who are willing to spend upwards of $ 3000,– for a PC anyway.<br><em>Secondly</em>—and more importantly—Apple doesn't have to churn out huge quantities of the Mac Pro in a short time. They can give workers in the U.S. the time to do their job in order to guarantee the quality customers expect from Apple.</p><p>The last thing that I think is not to be misunderstood is Apple's reasoning for doing this: This is not a political move. From my understanding of the company, it's another attempt by Apple to exert more control over the manufacturing process of their devices. This is something they have to sacrifice when producing in China.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Realmac Software has a nice post on their blog, outlining a few tips on how to keep your iOS device secure. The one I didn't know about involves the passcode lock:</p><blockquote>Before you Turn Passcode On you should consider whether to turn Simple Passcode off. With Simple Passcode on you will set a 4-digit number, with it off you can set a longer alphanumeric passcode. Longer alphanumeric passcodes are more secure but also a little more fiddly to enter on the lock screen as you'll be presented with the full keyboard instead of the numeric keypad. But here's a pro tip where you can get best of both worlds. If you have Simple Passcode off and set a long passcode that only contains numbers the lock screen will now present the numeric keypad instead of the full keyboard. Now you can choose a longer, more secure numeric passcode which is both easier to remember and quicker to enter that an alphanumeric one.</blockquote><p>Pretty nifty if you ask me.

So here's what I did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Check if the apps that I use on a daily basis are Mountain Lion compatible. This can be easily done using the site <a href=\"http://roaringapps.com\">RoaringApps</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Backup my user data with Time Machine. This works pretty fast in my case, because I do TM backups on my Mac mini's secondary internal drive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Clone my Mac mini's primary HDD with <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper!</a>, twice. I have one backup that goes to a FW800 HDD, usually updated daily and a secondary backup on a USB2.0 HDD that I won't touch until I'm fairly certain that 10.8 works fine. Of course, I checked the integrity of both backups, by booting from them.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it. Mountain Lion can come.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The appointment of Marissa Mayer as Yahoo's new CEO caught almost everybody by surprise. Even more surprising was the shockingly small number of proclamations of doom, despair and disaster for Yahoo as a result of her appointment.</p>\n<p>Most seem to think that Mayer, having been one of Google's best, is capable of at least turning Yahoo around, making it relevant again. Her <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/\">initial memo to the company's employees</a> certainly makes her seem more level-headed than most CEOs these days; it looks as if she knows what's at stake.</p>\n<p>(If you want to listen to a good discussion about Ms. Mayer and what she might mean for Yahoo, listen to <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/amplified/16\">last week's episode of Amplified.</a>)</p>\n<p>I wish her all the success in the world, but to be honest, I really only want Yahoo to fix Flickr. <br />\nI wasn't upset when Yahoo bought the service, even forcing me to log-in with my Yahoo credentials didn't really phase me. What bothers me is the state of the service that has gone from <em>the</em> photo sharing site on the internet, to a spam-overrun site that people only use because there's no real alternative. At least there's none for those of us who just want an easy way to store and share our photos — 500px is nice, but feels more like a portfolio for professional photgraphers and ambitious amateurs.</p>\n<p>Flickr needs to rethink these three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>UI</strong>: This is the most obvious one. It's clunky, impractical, not optimised for anything and it takes to many steps to get anything done. The entire user experience is frustrating.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Community and sharing</strong>: While the sharing features have become better, Flickr's insistance on adding links to their service anywhere and everywhere when posting one's pictures online is annoying. Integration with third party services for sharing is rudimentary at best, the commenting system is close to useless and SPAM is abundant.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Orientation of the service</strong>: What's Flickr for? A portfolio for photographers? A place to save all your photos? A site to share your snapshots with the world? Else? Can it be all at once?</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I realise that everyone has different needs and expectations of a service like Flickr, but these are the things I'd change had I any say in the future of Flickr:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user interface that puts my content left, front and center, giving me an easy way to showcase everything from quick snapshots to photographs I'm actually proud of. Hire some talent for the UI revamp. Off the top of my head I can think of a decent number of designers who'd be up to the task of helping make Flickr better, the <a href=\"http://iconfactory.com/\">Iconfactory</a>, <a href=\"http://impending.com/\">Impending</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pacifichelm.com/\">Pacific Helm</a>, <a href=\"http://robocatapps.com/\">Robocat</a> and <a href=\"http://blackpixel.com/\">Blackpixel</a> being among them.</li>\n<li>Show photos in a way that gives the people I share them with the best quality whichever device they view them on.</li>\n<li>Give the user the option to hide metadata, tags and other information on the site. This could be done as a per-user setting (<em>Always show metadata</em> or <em>Never show metadata</em>) or by making it visible at the tap/click of a button. It's the photo that's important, the EXIF stuff is uninteresting for regular users and secondary even for most geeks.</li>\n<li>Make it easy for me to get my photos on Flickr by optimising the uploading process.</li>\n<li>Offer an API for Twitter clients (and other services) that lets me push photos to Flickr from anywhere, retaining not only the photo's metadata but also information that puts the photo into context (like the tweet it was posted in initially). A second step would be to allow hotlinking in tweets, so photos shared via Twitter don't result in the client opening a slow and shitty mobile site that gives the user a picture not much bigger than a thumbnail.</li>\n<li>Offer native apps that take advantage of devices's strengths and have their shortcomings in mind. For example: I'd expect an iPad app to deliver close to the same functionality the website does, while the iPhone app should let me easily view photos, upload and share them, as well as making it easy to edit/add basic information. </li>\n<li>Emphasise sharing and commenting by pulling reactions to my photos from Facebook, Twitter and showing them alongside comments on Flickr. Oh and tell me when someone has commented on them — the current implementation of an activity stream on the site is pretty much useless.</li>\n<li>Do something about mindless spam. Let me allow certain people to comment on photos, let me restrict the possibility for others to add my photos to groups, etc.</li>\n<li>Most of my photos are important to me, they capture memorable moments and losing them would be disastrous. Allow me to backup my photos easily, giving me peace of mind that they're safe from things like harddrive failure on the one hand and prying eyes on the other hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only thing I wouldn't change is the pricing scheme: A simple but limited free account and a pro account with all the bells and whistles for around $ 25,- (I wouldn't even mind it being a bit more expensive).</p>\n<p>I was very close to deleting my account with Flickr a few months ago, but now I feel that there's hope for the service to become useful again. I guess we'll just have to be patient.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Peter Cohen of <a href=\"http://loopinsight.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Loop</a> has a few comments on the whole \"Google has bought Sparrow\" situation, referring to a smart article by  Marco Tabini. Unfortunately there's one point in Tabini's piece that I believe ignores the reality of buying software licences.</p><p>I encourage you to read both posts. My take on the situation can be found below and in the comments of the article on The Loop.</p><div class=\"sqs-link\"><a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/07/22/on-sparrows-google-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">On Sparrow’s Google acquisition</a></div><blockquote>I can get behind most of what Tabini wrote in his article, but not the quoted passage. In it he warps what he calls \"the simple reality of commerce\". By definition customers who buy your products are stakeholders, they take a chance with your product and thus a stake in your business. This especially holds true for licensable goods like software as they are durables and not consumables like, say, toilet paper (here your business relationship and expectation ends once you've wiped you butt with it).</blockquote><blockquote>Tabini says that you should buy software that suits your needs, not because you have some hopes about its future, yet when a person invests in software by form of a licence, they expect to get a certain use out of it that extends beyond using it once or twice. Buying and using software is more akin to a service relationship than to buying physical goods.</blockquote><blockquote>Now to be perfectly clear: I don't expect developers to support a piece of software indefinitely — not for free at least. The question of \"How long is long enough?\" leads to a wholly different world of pain, but as JimD has correctly pointed out, OS updates do tend to break software and Sparrow for the Mac and iOS haven't been on the market for very long.</blockquote><blockquote>The same holds true for Pulp for the iPad by Acrylic Software, an app that hasn't been around very long either and that I bought — yup, my fucking luck — three hours before the announcement of the acquisition by Facebook. After purchasing the app, I found out that certain essential aspects of the software didn't work as advertised, something I'd expect the developer to improve on. Now that they've been purchased none of this will happen and I basically have a dud sitting on my iPad.</blockquote>\n",

Do they build for legacy Windows first, then if there’s time/resources, Windows RT? Or do they build for Windows RT and leave old-timey Windows in the past?</blockquote><p> It shows that (1) Microsoft still hasn't developed the balls to say goodbye to the legacy crap that's been holding them back for almost a decade now, and (2) these things have little chance of becoming actual competitors to the iPad.</p><p>I predict that the only software good enough to compete with iPad apps will run on the ARM tablet; which requires developers with a willingness to do the legwork on this new platform and the slightest hint of what good UI design looks like. I hope for the sake of customers and Microsoft, that Redmond will provide developers with a good SDK for Windows RT applications and even better support.</p><p>If that doesn't happen — and I'm quite sure it won't — we'll end up with a Windows 8 tablet that isn't better than a 10-year-old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Compaq_TC1100\" target=\"_blank\">Compaq TC1100</a> running Windows XP. Why? Because most companies and lazy independent developers will stick to their guns and continue to build powerhungry, unoptimised, legacy crap that barely even runs on the Windows 8 tablet under the guise of offering \"the full Windows experience\".</p><p>The only way Microsoft can achieve any relevance in the tablet/post-PC market, is if they're willing to drag their customers and developers — especially the corporate ones — kicking and screaming into the current decade.</p>\n",

As of now it's also unclear when Reeder's developer Silvio Rizzi will release Reeder for iPad 3.0.</p><p>I also hope that by the time Mr. Ricci has Reeder 3.0 for iPad ready to go, the app will also support in-app feed management for Fever accounts, which it currently doesn't and receive a better visual implementation of Fever's ranking feature (both are things the MacStories review criticises).</p><p>For the time being I'm going to enjoy reading my RSS in Reeder 3.0 for the iPhone, and I somehow get the feeling that it's going to be used more often than the iPad app.</p>\n",

Many people expected this, still, 2880 by 1800 pixels is simply incredible for a 15.4“ notebook panel. From what I’ve read, Sharp builds them and I’d love to know for just how long Apple has reserved — read: bought-up — all production capabilites for this component.</li><li><em>Exhibit 2:<i><br></i></em>Cooling vents that not only serve to let cool air get into the device, but also work as stiffening elements for the body of the notebook; making it even more robust without making it heavier and thicker.</li><li><em>Exhibit 3:<i><br></i></em>Fans with asymmetrically spaced blades and an improved airflow architecture that reduces noise. I would've suspected that this was born out of necessity, because the internal components needed to deliver the level of performance the new MacBook Pro offers, are going to produce a lot of excess heat. But accounts by <a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/06/11/first-look-retina-display-macbook-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Dalrymple</a> and others suggest that it's very hard to get the notebook to even audibly spin up the fans, let alone become warm.</li><li><em>Exhibit 4:<i><br></i></em>The battery. Not only has this machine enough juice to run for seven hours, depite its power hungry innards — due to past experiences I believe Apple doesn’t overstate this number — it's also packed neatly and symetrically into the notebook and at the front of the casing, probaly giving it a nice centroid, comparable to a Lotus Elise ;)</li></ul><p>Not even a day after the announcement of the machine, I’ve seen reports by blithering idiots, neckbeards, trolls and New Media Douchebags deriding the new machine for being;</p><ul><li>Made by Apple — which is bad because Apple is _evil!_</li><li>Too expensive — GAAAH! Apple TAX! GAAAH!</li><li>A disappointment, because it doesn’t have feature X, Y & Z.</li><li>Not trumping every weird-ass gamer laptop on the planet based on specs.</li></ul><p></p><p>To all of these numbnuts I say this: I triple dog dare you to find me a laptop that;</p><ul><li>is built half as well — we’re going to figure out how to quantify this</li><li>has the same or a better display,</li><li>as well as proper OS and application support for the insane resolution,</li><li>has the same or a better runtime on one charge,</li><li>and compares well on the remaining specifications.</li></ul><p>All for the same or a lower price in the coming six months — hell, I’d be willing to give you a year. If you can manage this, I’m going to bake you cookies, write „Apple sux!“ on them and send them to you.</p>\n",

				"title": "The WWDC 2012 keynote was a massacre",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Another WWDC keynote in the bag. And what a behemoth of a keynote it has been. Not having had time to follow live blogs, I caught up on the announcements through the Apple’s video of the event and by reading up on the details on Apple.com and other good sites.<br>I know I'm late to the game with my keynote recap, but there were many interesting software announcements too good not to be discussed.</p><p></p><p>My overall impression of the event and the announcements was that Apple is flexing its muscles. One major new hardware release, many minor revisions and upgrades and two OS updates at once. This should give the competition a glimpse at what Apple is capable of today, most even likely not even beginning to stretch their resources.</p><p>Here's the rundown of the features I'm most excited about:</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>iOS 6</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/\" target=\"_blank\">Siri</a> only available on the 3rd gen. iPad — This is kind of a bummer, but it’s in line with Apple’s product strategy, meaning it was to be expected and is probably hardware-related, at least to some degree.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#facebook\">Facebook integration</a>: DUH!</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#maps\">Maps</a> look simply beautiful, but having to compete against Google Maps and Google Earth is not going to be easy; Apple has their work cut out for them. The application will put pressure on developers of Turn-by-Turn Navigation apps, because just like on Android, the solution integrated into the OS might be sufficient for many people.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#photostreams\">Shared Photo Streams</a> is a neat way to privately share photos without having to upload them to a social network. From the looks of it, the minimal design puts the content first and further sharing options second.</li><li><a href=\"#\">Passbook</a> is our answer to how Apple thinks mobile payments should look like. I don’t see NFC appearing in Apple’s devices anytime soon.</li><li>The new features in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#phone\">phone application UI</a> were long overdue. Android has had them for years and they’ve even existed in not so smart phones — those with memories that go back further than four years might remember.</li><li>I like the better handling of Messages across devices. When someone sends an iMessage to my phone number, I’m now going to receive it on my iPad and Mac, too. Great!</li><li>This one I’m extremely excited about, the Do Not Disturb feature. Seriously, what took them so long? Finally (yes, I said it) I won’t have to put my phone into Airplane Mode at night to have peace and quiet. Extra props for the fine tuned options.</li><li>I didn’t see Google show up in the search fields of iOS devices, only a generic 'Search' term. Might there be a chance for additional search engines besides Google, Bing and Yahoo? I’m talking about DuckDuckGo of course. I’m trying hard not to get my hopes up.</li><li>The new store designs and China-centric features are appreciated.</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>OS X Mountain Lion</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/\">10.8’s pricing and upgrade conditions</a> are a thing of beauty. Microsoft should slowly start to get the drift.</li><li>Tighter <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#icloud\">iCloud</a> integration should’ve been there in Lion, but maybe I’m the only one who thinks that way. Easier machine setup is a good thing, though.</li><li>At this point, the built-in <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#reminders\">Reminders</a> app in iOS has replaced Things (by Cultured Code) for me. The implementation on the Mac (inside of iCal) has been far from good, but a native OS X Reminders app is going to make this complaint a thing of the past.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#notification\">Notification Center</a> is a very welcome addition, but I’m interested to see what kind of apps will be able to take advantage of its APIs; only Mac App Store apps, or any kind of app?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#powernap\">Power Nap</a> is a very interesting and potentially useful feature. From what Apple states as the system requirement for it, though, you’ll need a Mac with flash storage. I wonder if it’ll work with Macs that’ve been retrofitted with SSDs?</li><li>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dictation\">Dictation</a> feature will be an absolute productivity boon — especially with my Master’s Thesis looming on the horizon! I hope they’ve integrated some kind of fast language switching for this OS feature, because I’m definitely going to hop between English and German a lot.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Sharing</a> looks nice and I’m hoping for a public API so other services can make use of this — I just want to get rid of all those bookmarklets in my browser’s bookmark bar.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Safari</a> has received some good upgrades: Apple finally (yes, I said it again) got rid of the separate search box. Now, how about letting me set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine? The tab view is interesting, too, and iCloud tabs will surely come in handy. Apple’s attempting to improve password handling in OS X, let’s see how it compares to the likes of 1Password for regular users. The „Do Not Track“ feature and the ability to rename bookmarks in the bookmarks bar are welcome additions as well.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#autosave\">Auto Save</a> has been taught two nice new tricks, too: It automatically moves untitled documents to iCloud and APPLE BROUGHT BACK „SAVE AS“! YAY! No seriously, I still need this feature rather often.</li><li>The oh-so benevolent Apple has decided that a permanently displayed <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#calendar\">Calendar</a> sidebar is a good thing after all, same as a groups column in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#contacts\">Contacts</a> app and they improved the date picker. Regarding the first two: Why the hell did they remove it in the first place?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dashboard\">Dashboard</a>: It just won’t die. Persistent little fella. Personally, I like Dashboard and would be sad to see it go.</li><li>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#appstore\">OS X Software Update</a> feature and the Mac App Store are rolled into one app. I consider this to be a good thing. Equally good is the automatic download of and notification about software updates both for the OS and Mac App Store applications.</li><li>Mail, Mail, Mail, oh <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#mail\">Mail</a>. Tighter iCloud integration FTW I say, because the app (here we go for a thrid time) finally pushes recent senders, favorites, signatures, flag names, smart mailboxes, mail rules, and account information to all devices.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#quicktime\">Quicktime X</a> now uses hardware video encoding for H.264 content on newer Macs. I wonder if this’ll be somehow usable by other applications? But it neat in any case.</li></ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p >Earlier today, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HarryCMarks\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Marks</a> posted an article on his site rebutting an argument <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/47536638\">made by Jim Cramer of CNBC</a>. Here's the quote:</p><blockquote >When the smoke clears off this miserable Dell quarter, people will realize that Apple’s behind the destruction of the laptop,” Cramer said. “And with that destruction comes a world of hurt for just about everyone, save Apple.</blockquote><p ><a href=\"http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/5/25/apples-behind-the-destruction-of-the-laptop.html\">Harry Marks replied by saying</a>:</p><blockquote >It’s not a matter of the iPhone and iPad obsoleting the laptop. Apple’s success isn’t just with iOS devices, it’s with MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros, too. What Apple has done is obsolete poorly-made computers, poor shopping experiences, and poor customer service.<br>Apple isn’t destroying laptops, it’s making its customers happy. What are the other guys doing?</blockquote><p >He hit the nail square on the head. The other companies aren't only not doing anything, they're not even thinking.</p><p >Not limiting this to the tech business, I believe we might be witnessing the decline of \"Bullshit Companies\"; companies that are trying to bullshit their (potential) customers in many different ways: By pre-announcing products that might never see the light of day, by making promises they won't even attempt to keep,  by adding asterisk after asterisk and footnote after footnote in order to shroud the truth about what they are trying to sell and last but not least with bad customer service.</p><p >Apple being the one of the forerunners here (and a gargantuan at that), I'm starting to see more and more \"Non-Bullshit Companies\", companies that seem to work by a very simple business principle:<br><em>Here's what we offer. We believe it'll make your life easier in this and that way. Nothing more nothing less. This is how much we want for it.</em></p><p ></p><p ></p><p >Among other things the wild success of social funding platforms (like Kickstarter) illustrates where things are going:<br>If you have an honest and good value proposition, people will pay for it. Not out of the goodness of their heart, but because they know they're going to get something out of it.<br></p><p ></p><p >Here are a few examples of this, that I've noticed around me lately:</p><ul ><li >A new bus company has started to take advantage of the fact that the Deutsche Bahn (Germany's predominant railway company) isn't properly serving the population of the region. They set up a bus route covering the major cities on the way from Luxemburg to Frankfurt Airport. Their prices are good, the service is executed well and they know how to communicate.</li><li>A local beer garden, situated in one of the most scenic spots in Trier (with everything from a great vista, large meadows to football and beach volleyball courts) put up a sign telling customers that they could use its accommodations and bring their own food, as long as they buy their drinks here. You have no idea how uncommon this is and I'm sure that this was not the case last year. I should add that their beverage prices are very decent and the service is excellent, which only adds to the positive impression. This tactic has gotten them a lot of good will from guests and from what I have learned their food sales haven't declined and overall business seems to have improved.</li><li>How funny it may seem, my cellphone operator o2 Germany is on this list. The company has many flaws and does plenty of things wrong, but they offer a post-paid plan that is as simple as it can be, not forcing me into a long-term commitment, while having per-minute and data prices that are decent even compared to prepaid plans.</li></ul><p >Customers are smarter than most companies think and those still believing that trying to fool customers is the way to go, are going to realise that \"<em>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.</em>\" will turn into \"<em>Fool me once… FUCK YOU!</em>\" more quickly than ever before.</p><p >People don't begrudge companies for making money (not even for making boat loads of it), they just hate companies who are trying to do so by making false claims and essentially ripping people off. Only those businesses that are trying to make money without feeling the need to scam customers will prevail long-term and prosper. These are the companies that will get the money I earn.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Yesterday <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/14/sms-facebook\">John Gruber linked to an article</a> over at the New York Times, which stated that Facebook's messaging system, Apple's iMessage and similar services are slowly reducing the usage of SMS around the world. He said:</p><blockquote>It’s hard to think of a technology that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/01/atts-text-messages-cost-1310-per-megabyte/\">more deserves to die</a> than SMS.<br></blockquote><p>I have to disagree with that. SMS might be a limited standard in terms of what can be transferred, and as the link in Gruber's quote shows, the average cost for a SMS is incredibly high in the U.S.A. (even more so over here in Germany). Still, the service is useful, because 1. it is universally compatible with almost all types of cellular networks around the world and 2. because it's fairly reliable due to the fact that it works when a data connection (needed to send any kind of email, iMessage, Facebook message, etc.) cannot be established. More info on SMS <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS\">here</a>.</p><p>The problem is—as it is so often—greed by the carriers. A simple network-inherent, ubiquitous functionality is marketed and sold at a premium, with nearly no price decline over the last ten years.<br>SMS doesn't need to die, carriers should just stop charging customers for a fairly limited service that costs them close to nothing.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>David Chartier on Nick Denton's plans to reinvent online comments and publishing alongside it:</p><blockquote><a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2012/04/20/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-upside-down/\"></a>Mathew Ingram:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In particular, Denton hopes that handling comments in this way will encourage the subjects of stories to become involved in rebutting these reports directly on the site, instead of calling him to rant at him about them. “I want to take all of those people and I want to have them in the discussion,” he says. “I want to see the story evolve and see the rebuttal, and the rebuttal to the rebuttal.” Not only does that produce drama — something Denton admits he has a fondness for — but he believes it could also help to get at the truth, broadly speaking.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>I’m not a fan of Nick Denton or his Gawker blog network in general. But if he thinks he’s found a way to fundamentally improve comments, I’m willing to listen.</blockquote><p>This, to me, looks like an excuse to produce more inflammatory, link bait content, do even less fact-checking for stories and let the readers do the leg work. In turn this will lead to more aggravated and stupid commentary, which will then be positioned on the site prominently, so even more people will become enraged and click Denton's links. A concept like this does nothing to further the evolution of online content. It's like he says himself; it produces drama and drama equals clicks.</p><p>I agree that Gawker's commenting system is crap, especially the rewards system. Quoting Denton himself:</p><blockquote>It was a terrible mistake. It doesn’t work because people game it — and the people who game it are the people with time and social-media expertise, and those are not the people with information or insight. What person who actually has a job and a reputation… would give a f*** about getting some little badge like they’re in high school? It’s patronizing.</blockquote><p>This new system won't improve this situation, it'll make it worse for readers and better for New Media Douchebags, including Denton; the loudest people will get the most attention from Denton's site—because that's what he wants, make no mistake here—while the sane commentary will be mostly ignored because it doesn't generate the oh so desirable hits.</p><p><em>Source: <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2012/04/20/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-upside-down/\">Giga OM</a>, via <a href=\"http://windonaleaf.net/post/21549076116/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-on-its\">Wind on a Leaf</a></em><a href=\"http://windonaleaf.net/post/21549076116/nick-denton-wants-to-turn-the-online-media-world-on-its\"></a></p>\n",

Every time I see that, I hit the back button, and I bet you do too.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s because it’s vague. It’s supposed to sound exciting, but it’s not. It doesn’t say anything about what you can really do with the app.</p><br/><br/><p>Nobody wants to connect or discover.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n<p>— <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2011/12/08/on_the_tab_labels_in_the_new_twitter_app\" target=\"_blank\">Brent Simmons</a> on Twitter’s new nomenclature. Spot-on.</p>\n<p>I absolutely agree with Brent Simmons’s statement. Having read the articles by <a href=\"http://www.macstories.net/reviews/review-twitter-4-0-for-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Cody Fink</a> and <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/new_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">John Gruber</a>, I believe that—at least for me—Twitter’s apps (including the web app) have finally jumped the shark.</p>\n<p>The new Twitter iPhone app seems to be aimed at new users and “casual users”. Now, why did I use this word, almost devoid of meaning, “casual users”?<br/>I don’t think “casual users” are those who sometimes check Twitter to see what’s up; from personal experience those users are more likely to interact with a small amount of friends/other users, meaning that the most important features of Twitter are the timeline, conversations and direct messages. DMs, for one, are hidden in the last tab of the app. From Gruber’s article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Me”. Oh boy. Stashed into this tab are your profile, your direct messages, your Twitter Lists, and the interface for switching to other Twitter accounts. This tab is the conceptual carpet under which Twitter swept everything that didn’t fit under “Home”, “Connect”, or “Discover”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that’s exactly what happened.<br/>As I see it, Twitter is trying to hone-in on new users and what it <em>thinks</em> are “casual users”; users who sometimes check Twitter to stay up to date on the <em>latest happenings</em>, <em>trends</em> and <em>product offers</em> and interact publicly with their friends and acquaintances.</p>\n<p>Again, Gruber:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, this Discover tab is the successor to the late and unlamented dickbar — where sponsors will be able to pay Twitter to promote products and services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yup. Combine that with what Fink found out about this tab:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Discover is supposed to get better over time. Depending on where you’re located, who you follow, or what topics you find interest in, Discover aims to offer suggestions around those things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Until now Twitter’s applications allowed the users to make use of the service according to his/her needs, even the web app. Now Twitter is trying to steer users in a direction.<br/>For me this direction is called “We finally need a way to monetize this service.”, which Twitter perfectly entitled to do.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately that means many users will now (have to) steer clear of Twitter’s applications. Thankfully there are alternatives; <a href=\"http://twitterrific.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterrific</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stone.com/neue/\" target=\"_blank\">Twittelator Neue</a> cater to what I think are causal users; as they integrate DMs and @-replys and photos nicely into the timeline and create a seamless experience.<br/>On the other end of the spectrum there’s <a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Echofon</a> and <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetbot</a>; two clients help the user make the most of almost everything Twitter has to offer and give him/her quick access to almost any kind of information.</p>\n<p>I have found what I was looking for in Tweetbot. Tweetie and Tweetie 2.0 even more so, were the evolution of Twitter on the iPhone; the first clients that were more powerful than the website. Everything Twitter did to it after buying it, was adding features and altering it. Tweetbot has everything I loved in Tweetie 2.0, but with even more useful features, all packaged in a design that makes everything very accessible and a pleasure to use.</p></figcaption>\n",

It suggests that Christians are somehow persecuted, rather than the dominant religious and political force in the country. It suggests that gay people serving the nation that has long denied them full citizenship are something other than selfless heroes. And it states outright that children can’t “openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school”—both of which are blatant lies, unless something significant has changed without me hearing about it in the last six years. No, teachers can’t lead children in prayer—you may recall the establishment of religion clause, Governor Perry—but that didn’t stop a group of Christian students from gathering around the flagpole of my high school to pray several times a week.</p>\n<p>Rick Perry is the same presidential candidate who yesterday said that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/rick-perry-says-human-rights-for-gays-not-in-americas-interests/\" target=\"_blank\">improving the lives of gay individuals abroad was “not in America’s interests”</a> and suggested that <em>not being killed or imprisoned</em> in nations like Uganda is a “special right”.</p>\n<p>I’d really like to hear Rick Perry explain why it’s okay to burn <a href=\"http://costofwar.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">over a trillion dollars</a> to kill brown people overseas, ostensibly to prevent them from killing people, but it’s not okay to make American aid to foreign countries conditional on those countries not killing or imprisoning their own citizens based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Somehow I doubt Jesus would agree with Governor Perry’s priorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Religious heritage”???</p>\n<p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Pilgrim Fathers came to ‘The New World’ because of religious persecution and the wish for religious freedom.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I think someone should slap him with the First Amendment until he understands it — and not only the parts regarding religious freedom, but also those on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and interference with the right to peaceably assemble.</p>\n<p>One last thing: Could this man be kindly reeducated on one of the pillars of modern democracy? It’s called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state\" target=\"_blank\">‘The Separation of State and Church’</a>.<br/>A quick quote from Thomas Jefferson:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“… I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this guy gets elected president he might put the Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades to shame. I’m German—brought-up strictly catholic, turned agnostic—and I cannot do anything against scum like him, but <strong>crap</strong> like this video makes my blood boil.</p>\n",

You might call this the anti-free-software movement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s a great name for it. At this point, I am genuinely skeptical of free services or apps that can’t be bothered or flat-out refuse to implement some kind of a business model. I need tools and services I can depend on, not web services that get bought and shut down or pivot to chase the latest stupid trend, and definitely not free or open source apps that eventually get abandoned because they became too much work or the developers finally realized they need real jobs or had a kid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why I wished Tumblr would start charging money for the service, even if only for some kind of premium variant. I love the service, but apart from a few themes I haven&#8217;t paid them directly. Tumblr going away—by shutting down or being bought—would mean a lot of work and headaches for me.</p>\n<p>Many services could secure their existence and become even better by charging <em>something</em>.

I didn’t have any crashes so far, which wasn’t the case for the first one, and I’ve noticed that the game manages to get my iPhone 4S pretty warm.</p>\n<p>I can’t wait to spend more time with this game. <a href=\"http://infinitybladegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Go get it.</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-link\"><a href=\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\" target=\"_blank\">David Chartier on Shit work and technocentrism</a></div><p><a href=\"http://windonaleaf.net/post/12298687022/shit-work-and-technocentrism\" target=\"_blank\">chartier</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zach Holman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with shit work is that no one likes doing it, but an awful lot of people say they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with almost everything in this piece. It’s based entirely on one core assumption that is wrong in so many ways, I told Siri to set a timer for how long I can take to respond to this.</p>\n<p>Holman hates managing Twitter lists, Google+ circles, email folders, and task priorities, and leans on a couple anecdotes and process-alergic indie contractor Merlin Mann to argue that no one actually gets any value out of doing these things. That’s fine for the people who don’t really get these things, or those who don’t work in an environment where they are ever necessary. But a lot of people <em>do</em> get value from these processes in a variety of ways, from simple entertainment, to maintaining privacy while sharing online (which Holman shrugs off), to staying on top of crazy work schedules and informed on current events. Aside from the inevitable edge case examples, developers aren’t spending all this time on features no one asked for.</p>\n<p>One of Holman’s punching bags is Twitter lists. He doesn’t like them, doesn’t see the point, and doesn’t know anyone who thinks otherwise. I love and increasingly use Twitter lists, and I personally know a bunch of people who do as well. Stepping beyond my single anecdote, though, you don’t have to spend much time to find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mashable/lists\" target=\"_blank\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/4437400/Telegraph-Twitter-feeds-Who-to-follow-to-get-the-latest-news-reviews-and-pictures-straight-to-your-feed.html\" target=\"_blank\">others</a> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Favstar/lists\" target=\"_blank\">do as well</a>. I also found <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\" target=\"_blank\">great</a> Twitter <a href=\"http://www.stone.com/tweettv/\" target=\"_blank\">clients</a> that do good things with lists and make them easy to use, and isn’t that half the challenge almost any work imaginable? If your tools suck, doing the work will likely suck.</p>\n<p>I don’t need to trudge through every one of Holman’s “shit work” examples for you to get the picture. Just because you or like Merlin Mann doesn’t get or like a process doesn’t mean there’s no value in it, or that it’s “shit work.” Plus, leaning on a couple anecdotes to judge the big picture is just plain lazy. Writing these processes off because you don’t get them or don’t work in an environment where they can be useful is arrogant and ethnocentric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the post by Mr. Holman and I came to a similar conclusion. If Mr. Holman doesn’t like those tools, fine, but writing them off because of it, is self-centered punditry that we can do without.\n<br/>It’s black-and-white thinking of the highest (lowest?) order: “If a tools isn’t perfect from the get-go, the way <i>I</i> want it, it is shit altogether and nobody should even try to make it useful for them!”</p>\n<p>To be clear: I don’t cherish the fact that I sometimes have to sit down and sort people into Twitter or Facebook lists. But the 15 minutes I spend doing this increase the value of both tools immensly for me. Same goes for RSS feeds; fairly regularly I weed through them, checking which ones are still worth reading and which aren’t.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples:\n</p><ul><li>Twitter lists: While I don’t follow many people, I have a few key lists set-up. One of those is a list of friends and people whose opinion I value. Using this list in <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetbot</a>, I can quickly catch-up on recent happenings and discussions when I don’t want to go through 10 hours of my timeline.\n<br/>Mr. Holman might object by saying that this isn’t the way to use Twitter. Who in their right mind will spend time reading tweets so far back? Well, I sometimes do.</li>\n<li>Facebook’s new subscription feature: This is one of the most welcome additions to the service for me so far, because it allows me to select whose updates appear in my timeline. There’s a number of people I am friends with on Facebook, that I simply keep there to have a means of getting into contact without giving them my email address, but I don’t need to see every update of.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Apple is fallible, even if the 4S ends up being a success. A company that could do no wrong in recent history just, well, did wrong in the eyes of pundits who had previously viewed every Apple product announcement as a gift from the heavens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh no, not the poor, never-wrong-in-a-million-years pundits! Say it ain’t so, BGR.</p>\n<p>Related: can anyone offer a rational explanation as to why BGR is worth reading? Its rumors are consistently wrong and, in the last year or two, it’s stooped to publishing <a href=\"http://www.bgr.com/2011/10/03/sprint-guarantees-to-buy-over-20-billion-in-iphones-from-apple-launching-the-iphone-5-exclusively/\" target=\"_blank\">baseless pre-event bullshit</a> for pageviews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think Apple doesn’t give a shit what most of the pundits think and why should they. The disconnect between what pundits value and what consumers value is growing bigger and bigger and thus the irrelevance of pundits who equate their own needs with those of the average consumer.</p>\n<p>These people will undoubtedly slam a feature like ‘Find my Friends’ because they don’t understand it or have no real use for it, and because of that it has to be worthless to everybody else.

				"content_text": "<p>In the <a href=\"http://angrymacbastards.blogspot.com/2011/07/episode-119-is-up.html\" target=\"_blank\">latest episode of Angry Mac Bastards</a>, John Welch, Darby Lines and their lovely guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/verso\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Guimont</a> discussed an article from Business Insider, which cites UBS analyst Maynard Um titled <em><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-apple-tv-2011-7\" target=\"_blank\">“If Apple Television Is Next, Then So Is A “Genius Squad,” Says UBS”</a></em>.<br/>(The fun starts at time index 01:04:20)</p>\n<p>They pulled the story apart pretty thoroughly, but there were two things in the article that got me thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One newish idea from Um is that Apple will have to send out its geniuses to hook up Apple televisions in people’s homes. This would be another one of Apple’s competitive advantages, although Best Buy has a similar advantage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we envision of Genius Bar is similar to the Geek Squad, which is fairly well known in the US as Best Buy’s service department to facilitate technology adoption – television set installations, wireless router installations, repair services, content transfer from one PC to another, file backup, set-up services, general troubleshooting, tutorials, etc</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now to be clear: I don’t think Apple will or should build a TV, because this market is even more of a standard-resistant minefield than the cellphone business and the Apple TV seems to work fine for most people <em>and</em> helps Apple sell content.</p>\n<p>Addressing Um’s two points —and talking entirely out of my ass here— this is what I think Apple would do:</p>\n<ol><li>Build the device, the software and the packaging in a way that people won’t need help setting it up. In other words; make it idiot-proof.</li>\n<li>Get contracts in place with their favourite logistics providers that will have the delivery guy(s) carry the thing into the customer’s sitting room and maybe even heave it onto a wall.</li>\n</ol><p>The first thing is called intelligent design, which is something Apple seems to be really good at and the second thing is called outsourcing of non-integral tasks of the supply chain, something that Apple is also really good at.</p>\n",

I’m sorry that I’m not PRIVILEGED enough to be born a Native American so that I can receive financial help to FURTHER MY EDUCATION. I’m sorry you damned racist bastards are so fucking stuck in the past that you forget the current generations have NOTHING to do with what was done to Native peoples HUNDREDS. OF. YEARS. AGO.</p>\n<p>Do you KNOW why I struggle with hatred against Natives? ONE. REASON. ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS RACIST AND GIVES THINGS TO A CERTAIN RACE THAT, OH LOOK, <strong>I WASN’T BORN INTO</strong>. That is the only reason. You tell me to stop hating? Fuck you. Fuck you all to hell. Fuck you. Fuck you. <strong><big><big>FUCK YOU</big></big></strong>.</p>\n<p>What happened has NOTHING to do with me. WHY AM I SUFFERING BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID MISTAKES MADE BY PEOPLE FROM HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO? DROP IT ALREADY. DROP IT AND I’LL DROP MY DAMNED HATE. I HATE THE TREATIES. I HATE NATIVES. I HATE THAT THEY ARE SPECIAL AND YOU HAND THEM EVERYTHING.</p>\n<p>“Get good enough marks and you can have scholarships!”</p>\n<p>Well thanks a fucking lot. I guess having a lowest mark of 94% in my LAST semester of high school wasn’t good enough. I guess my 99% in history wasn’t good enough. </p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and to the friend that can’t even bother to fucking try and talk me through this and instead assumes I’m “taking my frustration out on Native people.” Fuck you too. I don’t even have a CHANCE to apply for SHIT from the government. They don’t have scholarships for students that are white anymore. There are programs ONLY for natives. Don’t tell me I don’t know anything. I’ve seen enough to know you guys are HANDED STUFF. MAYBE I DON’T FUCKING KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT I KNOW ENOUGH. Know what the government will give me? MAYBE two hundred bucks a month. IF I get a student loan. IF I am low income. IF IF IF. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IT. </p>\n<p>Now I’m sobbing. If there are people that can’t fucking take my rants, forget about being my friend. I’m upset. I’m tired of working hard not to be rewarded. What the hell is the point of working so much if it won’t make a fucking difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>…I don’t even have words for what I’m feeling right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No worries, I’ve got this.</p>\n<p>The reason you “struggle with hatred against natives” is because you have an irrational dislike (probably passed through your family) for a different group of people. The reason you rationalise it as something you feel because they get more help or rights than you is two-fold:</p>\n<ol><li>You’re smart enough and educated enough to know that you’re in the wrong on this, so you’ve reached for something that will allow you to continue being a bigoted jerk anyway.</li>\n<li>Your friends are smart enough and educated enough to know that you’re in the wrong on this, so you’ve reached for something that will allow you to con… oh, wait, this is actually the exact same reason.</li>\n</ol><p>Speaking as a straight cis white man from, I can absolutely guarantee you that you’re wrong about getting financial aid. Without financial aid from my government and my college, I wouldn’t have gone to college. If you want to go to college, and you got the grades you say you did, you can go to college. Trust me on this one.</p>\n<p>But let’s deal with the substance of your post, because… well, because it makes me furious. You feel like you’re being hosed, and I get that; I really do. It’s <em>terrible </em>that your people weren’t killed in probably the most massive genocide the world has ever seen. It’s <em>awful</em> that no one committed germ warfare against your ancestors, stole their land, marched them hundreds or thousands of miles, and gave them back a tiny bit of their own land to live on (along with widespread substance addiction). It totally sucks for you that your race isn’t used as a mascot by sports teams or used as a placeholder for “noble savagery” on dozens of TV shows every year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I’m sorry that the American government doesn’t exist purely to make sure that you personally get free money, even though it did make sure that you got a world-class education. Hell, you even knew enough to use the word “privilege” as a barb. I’m impressed. But I’m not sympathetic. Look around you. You have everything you need to further your education already.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR version: The world doesn’t owe you a goddamned thing. Go work for it, and stop complaining that people who’ve been fucked over for generations have it worse than you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This guy is a textbook example of an entitletard.</p>\n",

I don&#8217;t agree however with the assumption that the TouchPad has no differentiating features that would answer the above question.</p>\n<p>Just like Apple had to tell consumers why the iPod/iPhone/iPad will make their lives easier, HP is going to have to educate consumers about what the TouchPad does and what it does that the iPad does not do.

The courage and determination she showed facing a witch as powerful as Bellatrix out of love for her children and the strength she projected was unequaled in the books.</li>\n<li>Seeing more of Minerva McGonagall. She is by far my favourite character in the books and the essence of this character has been captured perfectly by Dame Maggie Smith. Any scene with her on screen instantly becomes a great scene.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Skype users who are both (a) smart and (b) paranoid will now re-read their Skype terms-of-service agreement more carefully: Microsoft just bought a fairly comprehensive database of who knows whom all over the world.\n<p>(I wouldn’t worry too much. Microsoft, unlike Google and Facebook, has yet to figure out how to monetize evil. It’s almost adorable.)</blockquote></p>\n",

I think you’d really dig it.</p>\n<p>Isn’t it amazing how it’s 2011 and we can just share these things quickly? Remember when you first used email and you were like, whoa dude, did you just send a <em>letter</em> to a possibly hot possibly girl in <em>Cambodia</em>? And you mean to tell me that she is going to be able to read it before I’m done saying this senten holy crap she wrote back already! Remember that? So since it’s 2011 this is going to be so much more amazing, yeah?</p>\n<p>Alright, let me find this bad boy. For some reason* I can’t search this app so let me simply swipe my way through every page of every issue until I see the article I mentioned. I appreciate your patience. Ok here it is. Hey also for some reason* I can’t directly email this or select it to send it to you, so let’s do this right. You ready?</p>\n<p>(*The pages are just dead images. There is no text to search or copy lol.)</p>\n<p>Ok, download Futurio from the App Store. Got it? Love the sound of FREE, yeah. Take that, 1999. Ok, now, scroll on over to issue #9, the one with the poorly compressed JPEG on the cover, oh wait, now it looks better. Ok, buy (sike!) that one. It’ll take a few minutes to download. No, we can’t play Words With Friends while we wait, are you nuts. Hell yeah the download would break and probably be impossible to continue later.</p>\n<p>Got it? Oh sorry, yeah, I’m eating a chicken confit sandwich. I had time to make it while the thing downloaded. Anyway, the article, the article… Right, it’s on page number, uh, well, ok it’s a big red page towards the back. Got it? Ok, it’s down at the end. No, scroll down. More. More. More. Ok there it is.</p>\n<p>I know! I also thought Amanda would love it. You should totally send it to her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s only a little bit better with some magazines in Germany.

Einige Beispiele im einzelnen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple verwandelt seine iPhone-Antennenprobleme in eine Marketing-Veranstaltung.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bereits dieser Satz im Teaser geht an dem vorbei was in der Pressekonferenz bei Apple behandelt wurde. Nach allen vorliegenden Daten besteht ein Problem mit der Antenne, welches einen sehr kleinen Prozentsatz der Nutzer betrifft und von Apple untersucht wird.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So verlor sich die vielleicht einflussreichste Figur des Silicon Valley denn auch in Rechtfertigungsphrasen. Erklärung zur Fehlerursache: Keine. Stattdessen lautet die Botschaft: Auch andere Handy-Hersteller haben mit Antennenproblemen zu kämpfen, selbst Apple sei nicht perfekt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RF-Technologie ist kompliziert und jeder Hersteller hat damit zu kämpfen. Diese Demonstration halte ich aufgrund der einseitigen Berichterstattung in den Medien für gerechtfertigt.</p>\n<p>Eingeständnisse zu geringfügig höheren Abbruchraten beim iPhone 4 werden in dem Artikel nicht erwähnt.</p>\n<p>Andererseits hat Steve Jobs die Frage nach den potentiellen Auswirkungen einer außen liegenden Metal-Antenne auf die Empfangseigenschaften nicht adressiert und wurde dafür auch prompt <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2010/07/unanswered-questions-unearned-trust.ars\" target=\"_blank\">von John Siracusa gescholten</a>, zurecht.</p>\n<p>Dies ist <em>berechtigte</em> Kritik von einer <em>technisch versierten</em> Person <em>ohne finanzielle Interessen</em>, nicht wie die Quellen die die Süddeutsche hier genutzt hat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wer den Perfektionisten Jobs kennt, der intern dafür bekannt ist, schon bei den kleinsten Problemen an die Decke kennt, kann sich das Zähneknirschen hinter dieser Aussage vorstellen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ad hominem, Spekulation, unnötig. Dies hat in einem solchen Artikel nichts zu suchen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> 22 Tage hatte Apple geschwiegen, …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Was Apple in dieser Zeit getan hat, wurde von Steve Jobs erklärt und von dem betreffenden Redakteur nicht erwähnt.</p>\n<p>Alles in allem zeigt sich hier genau die Problematik, die der Apple-Chef in der Präsentation und der nachfolgenden Fragerunde angeschnitten hat:<br/>Selbst gestandene Presseorgane haben sich dazu hinreißen lassen, für Besucherzahlen aus einer Fliege einen Elefanten zu machen.<br/>Aus den USA ist dieses Problem schon länger bekannt, aber es ist schade, dass es auch hier in Deutschland Einzug hält. Dieser Artikel ist nur die Spitze des Eisbergs;<br/>ähnliches durfte ich auf der Seite der Zeit auch häufiger lesen, als ich wollte, und besonders hier hätte ich so schlechte Journalistische Arbeit nicht erwartet (Beispiele: <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2010-07/iad-apple-google-admob\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/digital/mobil/2010-06/ios4-standortdaten-apple\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/digital/mobil/2010-07/apple-iphone-rueckruf?page=1\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>).</p>\n",

Oktober 2010 laufenden Mobilfunkvertrag im Tarif „Complete 120“.<br/>Der Grund für die Kündigung ist die veraltete und unflexible Tarifstruktur der Telekom, die sich nicht mit meinem Nutzungsverhalten vereinbaren lässt.<br/>Ich bitte um eine schriftliche Bestätigung der Kündigung an die oben angegebene Adresse.<br/>Außerdem beantrage ich die Löschung aller meiner personenbezogene Daten aus dem System der Telekom nach Ablauf des Vertrages und untersage die weitere gewerbliche Nutzung sowie die Weitergabe zu Marktforschungs- und Werbezwecken.<br/>Mit freundlichen Grüßen …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bin ja mal gespannt, wann ich den ersten Anruf bekomme und wann die Kündigungsbestätigung eintrifft.</p>\n<p>Ich beiße mit dem Barkauf eines iPhone 4 in London in den sauren Apfel, aber mit den Tarifen anderer Anbieter — in meinem Fall o2 — lässt sich mittlerweile eine Menge Geld sparen. Auf zwei Jahre hinweg gerechnet, bewegen sich die Ersparnisse je nach Nutzungsverhalten zwischen €200,- und €400,-</p>\n<p>Für all diejenigen, die nicht nach der Kündigungsanschrift der Telekom suchen möchten, steht sie hier als Referenz:</p>\n<p><em>Telekom Deutschland GmbH</em><br/><em>Kundenservice</em><br/><em>53171 Bonn</em></p>\n<p>Die Faxnummer lautet: <em>0800 330 100 9 </em></p>\n",
