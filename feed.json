				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m three rides in and so far I have only good things to say about the pants. Seems like a solid piece of gear with a single caveat: when worn in heavy rain, waterproof shoes with a high cuff are a must (more on that in the ride impressions).</p>\n<h2 id=\"holy-capitalism-batman-300-bucks-for-waterproof-pants\">Holy Capitalism, Batman! 300+ bucks for waterproof pants?</h2>\n<p>Yeah, that was my reaction when I first saw reports on a few cycling websites I read. The bad thing is that I was in the market for a new pair of waterproof pants because I had lost enough mass over the past few months that my Vaude pants simply didn&rsquo;t fit anymore.</p>\n<p>What I set out to find were pants that wouldn&rsquo;t be used over jeans or chinos, allowing for a tighter fit suitable for  foul weather road and off-road cycling and without a zippered leg cuff if possible.</p>\n<p>After some research the contenders were <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-trail-gore-tex-pants/product/ASG01XXAGR\">the Raphas</a> I ended up buying, the <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/en-us/shop/rain-overpants/\">Q36.5 Rain Overpants</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.foxracing.com/product/defend-3-layer-water-pants/30117.html\">Fox Defend 3-Layer Water Pants</a>. The Q36.5 were not advertised as off-road-worthy so despite the nice looks, I opted to order the Rapha and Fox pants because both were discounted around Black Friday.</p>\n<p>I was honestly hoping that the Fox would come out on top because really, I didn&rsquo;t see enough of a difference in quality of construction to justify the Rapha pants being more than 2× the price but … <em>nope</em>, that typical Fox cut that works so well for me in fair weather pants and shorts ended up a mixture of sagging on the back, constricting beneath my belly.

				"content_text": "## TL;DR \n\nI'm three rides in and so far I have only good things to say about the pants. Seems like a solid piece of gear with a single caveat: when worn in heavy rain, waterproof shoes with a high cuff are a must (more on that in the ride impressions). \n\n## Holy Capitalism, Batman! 300+ bucks for waterproof pants? \n\nYeah, that was my reaction when I first saw reports on a few cycling websites I read. The bad thing is that I was in the market for a new pair of waterproof pants because I had lost enough mass over the past few months that my Vaude pants simply didn't fit anymore. \n\nWhat I set out to find were pants that wouldn't be used over jeans or chinos, allowing for a tighter fit suitable for  foul weather road and off-road cycling and without a zippered leg cuff if possible. \n\nAfter some research the contenders were [the Raphas](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-trail-gore-tex-pants/product/ASG01XXAGR) I ended up buying, the [Q36.5 Rain Overpants](https://www.q36-5.com/en-us/shop/rain-overpants/), and the [Fox Defend 3-Layer Water Pants](https://www.foxracing.com/product/defend-3-layer-water-pants/30117.html). The Q36.5 were not advertised as off-road-worthy so despite the nice looks, I opted to order the Rapha and Fox pants because both were discounted around Black Friday. \n\nI was honestly hoping that the Fox would come out on top because really, I didn't see enough of a difference in quality of construction to justify the Rapha pants being more than 2× the price but … _nope_, that typical Fox cut that works so well for me in fair weather pants and shorts ended up a mixture of sagging on the back, constricting beneath my belly. The almost customary lack of a crotch zipper felt stupid on pants that are supposed to be waterproof. Oh and I quickly found that the elastic cuff of the Fox Defend 3L pants was tight enough to not fit over the cuff of my [Shimano SH-MW702](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/apparel-accessories/shimano-series-lsg-2022/SH-MW702.html) waterproof shoes. \n\n## Fit \n\nPretty darn good. \n\nImagine a well-fitting straight cut jeans crossed with contoured MTB pants and a fabric feel like your typical high-quality 3-layer laminated membrane. \n\nThe fastening system works very well; it can be adjusted both very easily and precisely. The slightly elongated back is also a welcome design choice, reducing the chances of rain and wet, sloppy dirt from your back tire making its way up your spine. \n\nThe legs are quite long and while that may seem an odd choice at first, it makes sense the second you get on the bike and start pedaling because it ensures that cuff can rest on or barely above your shoes when pedaling or moving around on the bike.  \nEven only three rides in, this is something I really appreciate because my posterior tibial arteries were always covered, reducing the chances of me feeling cold in strong winds and rain. \n\n## Ride impressions \n\nOn each of the rides I did with the pants I tried testing something else. Two were done on my road bike, one on the MTB. \n\n### Mixed-surface ride, road bike, 5-ish°C, dry but windy AF \n\nWore the Raphas over a my padded summer MTB bib shorts and full-length merino tights. I had mid-weight below-the-calf merino socks on my feet and my go-to cycling shoes, the [Specialized S-Works Recon Lace](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-recon-lace-gravel-shoes/p/205506?color=330102-205506) combined with a wind-proof toe cover. \n\nI typically suffer from my lower back and the sides of my butt becoming uncomfortably cool even in supposedly wind-proof bib tights. Not this time. The combination of merino mid-layer and properly wind-proof outer layer worked super well on this pretty long ride. The long leg meant no wind was cooling out my ankles and that added to the comfort.\n\n### Road ride, road bike, 0°C average temps, rain and snow + wet roads \n\nI paired the pants with my padded summer MTB bib shorts, long, unpadded and insulated Assos bib longs, and knee-high merino winter socks, as well as the Shimano MW-702 shoes. \n\nThe pants flowed well over the slick surface of the Assos tights and the aforementioned long legs meant that the pants stayed put over the cuff of my winter cycling shoes. \n\nThroughout the ride I felt properly warm and didn't overheat even on the hardest climbs of the route I chose despite a good amount of rain blocking evaporation on the membrane. Sure, I was sweaty when I got home but not wet from rain, snow, or road spray.\n\n### Off-road + trail ride, MTB, 10°C, windy and later the heavens opened up \n\nThis time I wore regular and slightly warmer padded bib shorts, no tights, some crew height mid-weight merino socks, my S-Works Recon Lace shoes + wind-proof toe cover. It was going to be a lot of climbing and sweating up the hills here and I also wanted to find out how the fabric of the pants felt on my skin and it wasn't bad but also not as nice as with flowy non-membrane fabrics.\n\nIt was supposed to rain that day but only later in the afternoon and that's why I didn't wear my waterproof shoes. Well, halfway up and not even halfway into the route it started to rain and then it poured. \n\nThis is where I get back to the **caveat** I mentioned at the very beginning: when there's rain, high-cuffed waterproof shoes are a must. The well-fitting elastic cuff of the pants funneled all of the rain, spray, and dirt into my shoes. Within minutes my cycling shoes were full of water and I was starting to get cold. \n\nEven so: my legs stayed dry and comfortable and I got home in a good state, my feet being the exception. I rinsed off my waterproof jacket and pants in the shower and was glad that all of the muck and rain didn't penetrate. \n\n## Here's to more rides \n\nThe mixed surface ride and this very mucky trail ride covered the pants in dust and wet dirt and I'm happy that there's no sign of abrasion so far. I'd be seriously alarmed if it were the case for a piece of gear so expensive but you never know. \n\nThe great fit is inviting and I'll be wearing them often this winter. \n",

I have four bikes: a titanium road bike with Shimano Di2 and Shimano hydraulic brakes, a titanium MTB with mechanical SRAM Eagle shifting and Hope hydros, an e-bike with mechanical SRAM Eagle and Magura hydros, and a Trek retro-mod with mechanical SRAM Eagle and … Magura hydro rim brakes.</p>\n<p>Both Magura and Shimano hydros are so ridiculously easy for me to service and even on tours I&rsquo;m not worried because essentially every bike shop can do it. The advantages and lack of maintenance of those over most cable-actuated brakes simply outweigh the negatives for me.</p>\n<p>A bit further into the video Russ talks about electronic shifting being the &ldquo;death of freedom&rdquo; but he also says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: humans are complex, there are certain aspects of my life where, you know, I&rsquo;ll go for that simplicity. For example: video editing, I&rsquo;m an Apple fanboy all day long. I just want things to work and in that instance I&rsquo;m willing to give up, you know, certain levels of customization and control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that <em>is</em> the thing: with shifting I perceive Di2 similarly to my Apple gear: they&rsquo;re both golden cages but very big and comfortable ones. When these products work and fit your needs, they are utterly perfect and effortless. When they don&rsquo;t, they can be incredibly annoying.<br>\nDi2 shifting has been nothing but great for me. Setup and maintenance are simple and easy, the components long-lived (bought mine used). I have the gearing I want for this bike (48/32 + 11-32) and there&rsquo;s even room to go 11-40 on that system with a Wolftooth Goat Link (as Jom from Gravel Cyclist confirmed).</p>\n<p>That said: the frame I&rsquo;m running Di2 on is a <a href=\"https://www.vannicholas.com/touring-bikes/yukon-disc\">Van Nicholas Yukon disc</a> with internal routing that is also fully compatible with wired shifting (even wired braking) if I ever want to go that route. It was important to me when I bought it because I did not want to get locked into electronic shifting systems.</p>\n<p>All in all, I had expected something more profound from the video.

I have four bikes: a titanium road bike with Shimano Di2 and Shimano hydraulic brakes, a titanium MTB with mechanical SRAM Eagle shifting and Hope hydros, an e-bike with mechanical SRAM Eagle and Magura hydros, and a Trek retro-mod with mechanical SRAM Eagle and … Magura hydro rim brakes. \r\n\r\nBoth Magura and Shimano hydros are so ridiculously easy for me to service and even on tours I'm not worried because essentially every bike shop can do it. The advantages and lack of maintenance of those over most cable-actuated brakes simply outweigh the negatives for me. \r\n\r\nA bit further into the video Russ talks about electronic shifting being the \"death of freedom\" but he also says, \r\n\r\n> Here's the thing: humans are complex, there are certain aspects of my life where, you know, I'll go for that simplicity. For example: video editing, I'm an Apple fanboy all day long. I just want things to work and in that instance I'm willing to give up, you know, certain levels of customization and control. \r\n\r\nAnd that _is_ the thing: with shifting I perceive Di2 similarly to my Apple gear: they're both golden cages but very big and comfortable ones. When these products work and fit your needs, they are utterly perfect and effortless. When they don't, they can be incredibly annoying.  \r\nDi2 shifting has been nothing but great for me. Setup and maintenance are simple and easy, the components long-lived (bought mine used). I have the gearing I want for this bike (48/32 + 11-32) and there's even room to go 11-40 on that system with a Wolftooth Goat Link (as Jom from Gravel Cyclist confirmed). \r\n\r\nThat said: the frame I'm running Di2 on is a [Van Nicholas Yukon disc](https://www.vannicholas.com/touring-bikes/yukon-disc) with internal routing that is also fully compatible with wired shifting (even wired braking) if I ever want to go that route. It was important to me when I bought it because I did not want to get locked into electronic shifting systems. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I had expected something more profound from the video. Russ and Laura make good content but this felt more like a rant about something he doesn't like because it doesn't fit his needs. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Wired: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/actually-gender-neutral-pronouns-can-change-a-culture/\">Actually, Gender-Neutral Pronouns Can Change a Culture</a></p>\n<p>Using the example of how the gender-neutral word &ldquo;hen&rdquo; changed perception and culture in Sweden, the authors of the article go through various issue that exist with making gender-neutral language the default.</p>\n<p>As I read the article, I realised how much the use of the singular <em>they/them</em> is ingrained in my vocabulary at this point, thanks to amazing friends and colleagues who helped me educate myself on this topic.<br>\nIt also made me wonder how I handle this in German, my native language.</p>\n<p>I speak English every day and for a living.

				"title": "Improving my bike fit using a smart trainer: what I learned",
				"content_html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My saddle was too low because the method I used to determine saddle height didn&rsquo;t work for me.</li>\n<li>I tried to overcompensate for what I perceived as excessive reach by moving the saddle forward. Moving it back instead and improving my posture worked a treat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"backstory\">Backstory</h2>\n<p>In mid-December 2020 another half-hearted lockdown loomed in my region and there was a possibility that exercise outside might actually be prohibited. That made the decision to finally pull the trigger on a smart bike trainer easy and I was lucky enough to snag a mid-range model before they went out of stock in Germany.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the smart trainer a lot and it&rsquo;s helped me improve my many aspects of my cardiovascular fitness. Something I&rsquo;ll write about at some point.<br>\nThe other benefit the bike trainer brought with it, was the ability to slowly but steadily improve my bike fit on both my road bike and my gravel bike. It&rsquo;s honestly had as much of, if not more of an impact on my riding as the marked improvement in fitness.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of good resources for picking the right size of frame and dialling in the right position of the touch points on a bike, to achieve an optimal riding position. The three that have helped me the most since December are,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZ241fyVfiv3eAJ4UYkzeb2JltpLSlzs\">Bike Fit Tuesdays</a>&rdquo; on Francis Cade&rsquo;s youtube channel,</li>\n<li>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL1_j_gcxtpxJ-b9ptUikhStxEvkm1V7E\">Bike Fitting Series (with Neill Stanbury)</a>&rdquo; on Cam Nicholls&rsquo;s youtube channel,</li>\n<li>And the article &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mantel.com/blog/en/how-to-determine-the-correct-saddle-height\">How to Determine the Correct Saddle Height</a>&rdquo; on the site of the cycling retailer Mantel, oddly enough.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The big issue with attempting to try all of the advice thrown around is that it&rsquo;s hard to do on the bike when out riding or not being able to pedal while sitting on the bike. That&rsquo;s where the trainer came in really handy and I&rsquo;d encourage anyone to either buy or rent one, if you want to improve comfort and efficiency on your bicycle<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong><br>\nGetting a professional bike fit has been something I considered to be something useful only for racers but I&rsquo;ve come to change my mind and would now recommend getting one to anybody who either plans on buying a new bicycle or has issues with comfort on their current one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-heres-what-i-learned\">So here&rsquo;s what I learned</h2>\n<p>The resources I linked to above have loads of great information and greatly improved my understanding of how certain changes to a bike influence my riding position. The findings listed here came as a bit of a surprise to me, or were generally counterintuitive based on the information that is out there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moving-my-saddle-back\">Moving my saddle back</h3>\n<p>James of Bicycle Richmond often mentions in the Bike Fit Tuesdays videos that many people buy bikes with excessive reach and then try to compensate for that by moving the saddle forward or hunching over the handlebars, which leads to all sorts of pains, mostly a lot of pressure on the hands and wrists.</p>\n<p>Well for me it was a bit of a mixed bag. The bicycle frames I have are the right size, from what I can tell. I&rsquo;ve already equipped my road bike and gravel bike with comparatively shorts stems (~ 7 cm) and the handlebars I use also have short reach figures. Still, I felt the need to use seat posts with no setback and moved the saddles forward, often as far as they went. I did so because of things I read about a good angle between torso and upper arms and a general impression of being too stretched out on my steeds.</p>\n<p>The result has always been the aforementioned impression of riding on a stretcher even while I felt hunched over the handlebars and putting a lot of weight onto my hands and wrists. This in turn caused numbness in my hands, sometimes after only 20–30 min of riding. On the bike trainer, when I wasn&rsquo;t shifting my position as often as I did riding outside, this effect was even more pronounced.</p>\n<p>In one of the bike fitting videos I learned about hip position over the bottom bracket and how being too far forward could result in pains and less power output. I gave it a try, gradually moving the saddle back<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and carefully tilting it forward a bit. This resulted in me rotating my upper body downward and my hip forward.<br>\nI was honestly stunned by how suddenly my core muscles had an easier time supporting my upper body, less weight resting on the hands, and the bike feeling less long even though I technically increased the distance between the nose of my saddle and the handlebars.</p>\n<p>Something was still a little off:</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-saddle-was-too-low\">My saddle was too low</h3>\n<p>This realisation was the single biggest revelation to my riding comfort and equally importantly; my cycling efficiency.</p>\n<p>One of the most commonly used methods to estimate/determine saddle height is the &ldquo;heel method&rdquo;, where you sit squarely on the saddle and place your heel on the pedal, with the leg fully extended. If you cannot extend the leg fully, move the saddle up. If you find that you&rsquo;re rolling of the side of the saddle trying to extend the leg, move the saddle down until you sit securely on the saddle again.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been setting my saddle height using this method for years and it <em>Turns Out™</em> that it doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>\n<p>Looking at a video my partner recorded, I noticed that in the lowest pedal position the underside of my foot was pretty much level with the ground and that the angle of my upper leg to my lower leg was larger than typically recommended.</p>\n<p>After some reading, I discovered two methods for calculating saddle height (see the article linked above) and they gave me totally different numbers than the heel method and a new starting point for experimentation.</p>\n<p>I gradually increased the height of my saddle and ended up with 3 cm more<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.

				"content_text": "**TL;DR**\n\n* My saddle was too low because the method I used to determine saddle height didn't work for me.\n* I tried to overcompensate for what I perceived as excessive reach by moving the saddle forward. Moving it back instead and improving my posture worked a treat.\n\n\n## Backstory\n\nIn mid-December 2020 another half-hearted lockdown loomed in my region and there was a possibility that exercise outside might actually be prohibited. That made the decision to finally pull the trigger on a smart bike trainer easy and I was lucky enough to snag a mid-range model before they went out of stock in Germany.\n\nI've been enjoying the smart trainer a lot and it's helped me improve my many aspects of my cardiovascular fitness. Something I'll write about at some point.  \nThe other benefit the bike trainer brought with it, was the ability to slowly but steadily improve my bike fit on both my road bike and my gravel bike. It's honestly had as much of, if not more of an impact on my riding as the marked improvement in fitness.\n\nThere are a lot of good resources for picking the right size of frame and dialling in the right position of the touch points on a bike, to achieve an optimal riding position. The three that have helped me the most since December are,\n\n1. \"[Bike Fit Tuesdays](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZ241fyVfiv3eAJ4UYkzeb2JltpLSlzs)\" on Francis Cade's youtube channel,\n2. \"[Bike Fitting Series (with Neill Stanbury)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL1_j_gcxtpxJ-b9ptUikhStxEvkm1V7E)\" on Cam Nicholls's youtube channel,\n3. And the article \"[How to Determine the Correct Saddle Height](https://www.mantel.com/blog/en/how-to-determine-the-correct-saddle-height)\" on the site of the cycling retailer Mantel, oddly enough.\n\nThe big issue with attempting to try all of the advice thrown around is that it's hard to do on the bike when out riding or not being able to pedal while sitting on the bike. That's where the trainer came in really handy and I'd encourage anyone to either buy or rent one, if you want to improve comfort and efficiency on your bicycle[^1].\n\n**Side note:**  \nGetting a professional bike fit has been something I considered to be something useful only for racers but I've come to change my mind and would now recommend getting one to anybody who either plans on buying a new bicycle or has issues with comfort on their current one.\n\n\n## So here's what I learned\n\nThe resources I linked to above have loads of great information and greatly improved my understanding of how certain changes to a bike influence my riding position. The findings listed here came as a bit of a surprise to me, or were generally counterintuitive based on the information that is out there.\n\n### Moving my saddle back\n\nJames of Bicycle Richmond often mentions in the Bike Fit Tuesdays videos that many people buy bikes with excessive reach and then try to compensate for that by moving the saddle forward or hunching over the handlebars, which leads to all sorts of pains, mostly a lot of pressure on the hands and wrists.\n\nWell for me it was a bit of a mixed bag. The bicycle frames I have are the right size, from what I can tell. I've already equipped my road bike and gravel bike with comparatively shorts stems (~ 7 cm) and the handlebars I use also have short reach figures. Still, I felt the need to use seat posts with no setback and moved the saddles forward, often as far as they went. I did so because of things I read about a good angle between torso and upper arms and a general impression of being too stretched out on my steeds.\n\nThe result has always been the aforementioned impression of riding on a stretcher even while I felt hunched over the handlebars and putting a lot of weight onto my hands and wrists. This in turn caused numbness in my hands, sometimes after only 20–30 min of riding. On the bike trainer, when I wasn't shifting my position as often as I did riding outside, this effect was even more pronounced.\n\nIn one of the bike fitting videos I learned about hip position over the bottom bracket and how being too far forward could result in pains and less power output. I gave it a try, gradually moving the saddle back[^2] and carefully tilting it forward a bit. This resulted in me rotating my upper body downward and my hip forward.  \nI was honestly stunned by how suddenly my core muscles had an easier time supporting my upper body, less weight resting on the hands, and the bike feeling less long even though I technically increased the distance between the nose of my saddle and the handlebars.\n\nSomething was still a little off:\n\n### My saddle was too low\n\nThis realisation was the single biggest revelation to my riding comfort and equally importantly; my cycling efficiency.\n\nOne of the most commonly used methods to estimate/determine saddle height is the \"heel method\", where you sit squarely on the saddle and place your heel on the pedal, with the leg fully extended. If you cannot extend the leg fully, move the saddle up. If you find that you're rolling of the side of the saddle trying to extend the leg, move the saddle down until you sit securely on the saddle again.\n\nI've been setting my saddle height using this method for years and it _Turns Out™_ that it doesn't work for me.\n\nLooking at a video my partner recorded, I noticed that in the lowest pedal position the underside of my foot was pretty much level with the ground and that the angle of my upper leg to my lower leg was larger than typically recommended.\n\nAfter some reading, I discovered two methods for calculating saddle height (see the article linked above) and they gave me totally different numbers than the heel method and a new starting point for experimentation.\n\nI gradually increased the height of my saddle and ended up with 3 cm more[^3]. Honestly, that's a lot. The effects of this modification were and are profound:\n\n1. I still feel perfectly planted on the saddle, perfectly secure sitting on the bike.\n2. In the lowest pedal position my heel now sits higher than my toes and my leg is extended further. This has led directly to my calf muscles being activated and me being able to put more power down.\n3. It made rotating my hip forward and my whole upper body downward even easier and even more comfortable.\n\n### Bonus: use a narrower saddle on a trainer\n\nThis one was a small but nice surprise.\n\nAt the beginning of my time with the smart trainer, I had specifically put a slightly wider saddle on my road bike thinking that the increased surface area would help spread the load I put on it, riding in a more static position than while out and about. After having already gone through the two steps above, I still felt some discomfort after a long time in the saddle on the trainer.\n\nLooking for information, I stumbled across a video on the youtube cycling channel GCN where someone asked for advice with saddle sores/butt pain on a bike trainer. Their guidance was to use a narrower saddle than what one would typically use but obviously something that still supports the sit bones fully, to encourage more movement and better circulation while on a static trainer.\n\nThis bit of advice turned out to be bang-on for me and brought the desired improvement.\n\n\n## In conclusion\n\nUsing a bike trainer allowed me to cautiously experiment and eventually massively improve my bike fit. I was lucky in the sense that my bicycles have the right size and my basic assumptions about reach and stem length were correct. Honestly, I should've gotten a trainer (or better: a proper bike fit) a long time ago.\n\nCycling on my bikes now, I'm much more relaxed, able to put much more power down at the same perceived exertion, and long rides are more enjoyable because my bikes feel more comfortable.  \nOn the gravel bike in tricky terrain there has been another positive side effect: due to the fact that I'm putting less weight onto the handlebars and being in a generally more balanced forward/aft position on the bike, I'm able to steer more nimbly. That gives me more confidence on technical climbs and descents and makes for a wildly improved and fun overall riding experience.\n\n[^1]: Another important part to this whole equation is being able to take videos of yourself on the bike trainer while pedalling (or having someone help you) while you wear tight-fitting clothing. It's going to make it easier to check and analyse your riding position.\n[^2]: At this point my saddles are set back about as far as they will go, a 2 cm change from before and I'm contemplating buying seat posts with built-in set back, to try if this will improve things further.\n[^3]: Note that how far up or down you go with your saddle is also influenced by the overall mobility of your hips and lower back and you need to take that into consideration.\n",

Oder wollt ihr mehr?</p>\n<p>Als ich die Meldung heute früh in der Tagesschau-App sah, war ich einfach nur fassungslos.</p>\n<p>Klar, von den oben genannten Personenkreisen habe ich derartiges Verhalten erwartet aber ich hatte trotzdem eine kleine, verschwindend geringe Hoffnung, dass dieser &ldquo;Lockdown Light&rdquo; <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> und die damit verbundenen Bedingungen und Ankündigungen von Konsequenzen bei Zuwiderhandlung irgendetwas bringen würden. Letztendlich hat sich wieder gezeigt, dass die Experten Recht hatten und es einen Scheiss gebracht hat.</p>\n<p>Die Landesregierungen haben, aus meiner Sicht, auf ganzer Linie versagt. Dieses permanente Hin-und-Her und die Weigerung den Empfehlungen der Bundesregierung zu folgen sind einfach nur peinlich. Dann noch dieses nervige, kontraproduktive Penisgewedel der Landesfürsten, um Kanzlerin Merkel auflaufen zu lassen und den Lobbyisten ja keinen Grund zu geben, die Angebote für zukünftige Aufsichtsratsposten in Frage zu stellen.</p>\n<p>Es reicht mir. Setzt endlich mal einen Lockdown an. Wir in Deutschland, und die westlichen Staaten insgesamt, müssen endlich von ihrem hohen, durchseuchten Roß runter kommen und sich anschauen, wie andere Länder es gemacht haben.

				"content_text": "So, liebe asoziale Querfuzzis, Pandiemieanzweifler, Verschwörungsmystiker, rechte Abschaumler, Neoliberale, FDP-Parteimitglieder, Faschistenkuschler in allen Parteien, reichen euch 600 Tote pro Tag und knapp 30.000 COVID-19-Neuinfektionen? Oder wollt ihr mehr?\n\nAls ich die Meldung heute früh in der Tagesschau-App sah, war ich einfach nur fassungslos.\n\nKlar, von den oben genannten Personenkreisen habe ich derartiges Verhalten erwartet aber ich hatte trotzdem eine kleine, verschwindend geringe Hoffnung, dass dieser \"Lockdown Light\" [^1] und die damit verbundenen Bedingungen und Ankündigungen von Konsequenzen bei Zuwiderhandlung irgendetwas bringen würden. Letztendlich hat sich wieder gezeigt, dass die Experten Recht hatten und es einen Scheiss gebracht hat.\n\nDie Landesregierungen haben, aus meiner Sicht, auf ganzer Linie versagt. Dieses permanente Hin-und-Her und die Weigerung den Empfehlungen der Bundesregierung zu folgen sind einfach nur peinlich. Dann noch dieses nervige, kontraproduktive Penisgewedel der Landesfürsten, um Kanzlerin Merkel auflaufen zu lassen und den Lobbyisten ja keinen Grund zu geben, die Angebote für zukünftige Aufsichtsratsposten in Frage zu stellen.\n\nEs reicht mir. Setzt endlich mal einen Lockdown an. Wir in Deutschland, und die westlichen Staaten insgesamt, müssen endlich von ihrem hohen, durchseuchten Roß runter kommen und sich anschauen, wie andere Länder es gemacht haben. Schaut mal auf Asien und Australien.\n\nDann noch bitte Mittel zum Schutz der Allgemeinheit unbürokratisch zur Verfügung stellen und Verstöße gegen die Pandemieeindämmungsverordnungen mit sensiblen, an das Einkommen der Person oder Organisation geknüpfte Strafen ahnden und wir könnten es nach sechs Wochen vielleicht schaffen da raus zu kommen.\n\nIch hatte bisher Glück und bin weder selbst infiziert, noch jemand in meiner näheren Umgebung, und es gab im Familien-, Freundes- und Bekanntenkreis erst sehr wenige Tote. Aber selbst die waren zu viel. Ich habe keine Lust, dass den Personen, die ich liebe etwas zustößt, weil irgendwelche Asozialen sich weigern die Gemeinschaft zu unterstützen.\n\nIch werde fortan Solidaritätsverweigerern gegenüber keinerlei Toleranz zeigen.

These are absolute overkill for a lot of the gravel roads that I encounter. The Specialized Pathfinder Pro with 38 mm on my second wheel set (slick center channel and fairly tame knobs on the sides), are far more appropriate and offer much more versatility.\nThe reason the Nano 40 spend more time on my bike than the Pathfinders, is because in recent months, I&rsquo;ve been riding on terrain that would typically be considered MTB territory most of the time. And even if I leave out the occasional section of tame single track, I kind of enjoy going up challenging climbs with this bike; loose ground, roots, and sometimes muddy paths, where I struggle to find traction even with the WTB Nano 40 at low pressures and a gearing of 30 in the front and 40 in the back.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-W6NsDnV/0/02f5076e/X5/i-W6NsDnV-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Titanium gravel bike with muddy tyres leaning against a wooden pole, in front of a slightly blurred forest scenery\"></p>\n<p>The Specialized Pathfinder Pro are an utterly delightful bit of rubber. Very much comparable to the excellent Donnelly X&rsquo;Plor MSO 40 mm but more durable. They take a bit of getting used to, in that finding the right tyre pressure for the right terrain and rider/system weight isn&rsquo;t as simple as with other tyres. Once I had a rough idea about that, it was simple to do the first half of a ride on gravel with stupid low pressures, letting the Pathfinder Pro climb really well and spend the second part of the ride blasting down a hill on tarmac, the tyres inflated to a higher pressure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Snapshots/2020-10/i-mt8wJ8Q/0/c2928437/X5/C1A5D4F5-C2A3-4FDE-AAE0-C5973670F516_1_201_a-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Close-up photograph of the back wheel of a gravel bike to showcase the semi-slick Specialized Pathfinder Pro gravel tyre\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I have the WTB Nano 40 but at the same time, it would have been nice to know and understand the true capabilities of seemingly tame gravel tyres.<br>\nSo if you&rsquo;re looking for a good set of rubber for your do-it-all bike, think hard on where you ride and do some research before defaulting to the monster truck option.</p>\n",

And even if I leave out the occasional section of tame single track, I kind of enjoy going up challenging climbs with this bike; loose ground, roots, and sometimes muddy paths, where I struggle to find traction even with the WTB Nano 40 at low pressures and a gearing of 30 in the front and 40 in the back.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-W6NsDnV/0/02f5076e/X5/i-W6NsDnV-X5.jpg \"Titanium gravel bike with muddy tyres leaning against a wooden pole, in front of a slightly blurred forest scenery\")\n\nThe Specialized Pathfinder Pro are an utterly delightful bit of rubber. Very much comparable to the excellent Donnelly X'Plor MSO 40 mm but more durable. They take a bit of getting used to, in that finding the right tyre pressure for the right terrain and rider/system weight isn't as simple as with other tyres. Once I had a rough idea about that, it was simple to do the first half of a ride on gravel with stupid low pressures, letting the Pathfinder Pro climb really well and spend the second part of the ride blasting down a hill on tarmac, the tyres inflated to a higher pressure.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/Snapshots/2020-10/i-mt8wJ8Q/0/c2928437/X5/C1A5D4F5-C2A3-4FDE-AAE0-C5973670F516_1_201_a-X5.jpg \"Close-up photograph of the back wheel of a gravel bike to showcase the semi-slick Specialized Pathfinder Pro gravel tyre\")\n\nI'm glad that I have the WTB Nano 40 but at the same time, it would have been nice to know and understand the true capabilities of seemingly tame gravel tyres.  \nSo if you're looking for a good set of rubber for your do-it-all bike, think hard on where you ride and do some research before defaulting to the monster truck option.\n",

				"title": "Nice little 2× drivetrain gear ratio quirk",
				"content_html": "<p><code>Warning, this may be a bit wordy and nerdy.</code></p>\n<p>I have been researching drivetrain options again—don‘t judge me—because I found myself wanting a bit more evenly and tightly spaced gears on both my road bike and my gravel bike.<br>\nThe area I moved to a while back (southern Black Forest, Germany) is an absolute dream for cyclists: I can climb to my heart‘s content either on- or off- road and when I just want to go fast on the flat, a short trip into the <em>wiiide</em> Rhine valley and it‘s <strong>go-time</strong> – yes, I went there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-setup\">Current setup</h2>\n<p>On Panthor, my road bike, I presently have a 1× (single chainring) setup using a 36-tooth chainring and a 12-speed 9–46 e*thirteen TRS+ 2nd gen cassette. For the 11 gear shifts, I get an average gear ratio change of 13.8%. The gear ratio in the lowest gear is 0.78 and in the highest gear it‘s 4.0.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>On Battle Cat, my gravel bike, it’s a 1× setup with a 32-tooth chainring on the front and a 11-speed 9–39 e*thirteen XCX cassette on the back. That gives me a solid 0.82 gear ratio on the bottom end of the spectrum and 3.55 on the top end, as well as 10 gear changes with an average gear ratio change of 13.6%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-things-up\">Changing things up</h2>\n<p>Digging into some good combinations of cassette and chain rings, I had two sets of requirements</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A closer grouping of the gears on the road bike is desirable but with at least one climbing gear with a gear ratio below 1.</li>\n<li>A low climbing gear on the gravel bike is a must given the steep and quite technical terrain I‘m riding more and more often but I also want fairly evenly spaced gears throughout the range, to tackle longer rides across varied terrain more comfortably.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There‘s an incredible amount of choice in the market for realising what I wanted on both bikes but in all cases I found out that a 2× (double chainring) setup was probably the only way to get there.</p>\n<p>Most cyclists know or have heard that a 2×11 setup typically offers 14 unique gears. This can vary depending on the choice of  chainrings and cassette in the back. I‘ve compared a lot of cassettes and chainring combinations using a nifty little online gear calculation tool by <a href=\"https://www.j-berkemeier.de/Ritzelrechner.html\">Jürgen Berkemeier</a>; everything from the e*thirteen and Shimano cassettes I have at home to options from SRAM, Sunrace, Garbaruk, KCNC, etc.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I looked at various double chainring options, ranging from insane 53/38 to the 46/36 I still have on my Rotor 3D30 crankset to 46/30. Most of those combinations when paired with almost any cassette end up giving me 14 unique gears, a few give me 15 and even fewer only 13.\nInterestingly, depending on the difference in teeth between the big and small chainrings, I‘ve seen cassette + double-chainrings combinations where the shift from big to small or small to big chainring (and compensating in the rear) results in a 2%–4% gear ratio increase. I‘d consider this barely usable, which means that these combinations really only offer 14 instead of 15 or 13 instead of 14 unique and usable gears.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-heres-the-funny-bit\">Now here‘s the funny bit.</h2>\n<p>46/30 chainrings are the only ones I found that, paired with the right cassette in the back, end up with 15 proper, unique gears and a change from the small to the big front ring (again while compensating 3 gears on the cassette), results in an actually usable jump of 7%–9%.<br>\nI checked other variations of 16-tooth difference chainrings but none seemed to work out with such a high gear ratio increase.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>It gets even funnier looking at the cassettes. Only two cassettes I‘ve found, have cog size spacing that results in 15 proper gears:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shimano CS-R8000 11–32</li>\n<li>Shimano CS-M8000 11–40</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-now\">What now?</h2>\n<p>I‘m going back to 2× on both my bikes. – <em><strong>GASP!</strong></em></p>\n<p>Panthor is going to receive a 46/30 chainring coupled with the 11–32 cassette. This gets me a gear ratio of 0.9375 in the lowest and 4.18 in the highest gear and and average gear ratio change of 10.11%, a reduction of ~ 3.6%. This average value may not sound like too much but looking at the gear ratio changes across the current 11 and soon 14 shifts, it‘s substantially closer gearing that‘ll give me a much more consistent cadence.</p>\n<p>Battle Cat will also get a 46/30 chainring connected to a 12–40 cassette.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> The low gear will offer a ratio of 0.75—<em>WOOOOO! Insane climbs here I come!</em>—and the high gear is going to have a value of 3.83, which is plenty.

				"content_text": "`Warning, this may be a bit wordy and nerdy.`\n\nI have been researching drivetrain options again—don‘t judge me—because I found myself wanting a bit more evenly and tightly spaced gears on both my road bike and my gravel bike.  \nThe area I moved to a while back (southern Black Forest, Germany) is an absolute dream for cyclists: I can climb to my heart‘s content either on- or off- road and when I just want to go fast on the flat, a short trip into the _wiiide_ Rhine valley and it‘s **go-time** – yes, I went there.\n\n## Current setup\n\nOn Panthor, my road bike, I presently have a 1× (single chainring) setup using a 36-tooth chainring and a 12-speed 9–46 e*thirteen TRS+ 2nd gen cassette. For the 11 gear shifts, I get an average gear ratio change of 13.8%. The gear ratio in the lowest gear is 0.78 and in the highest gear it‘s 4.0.[^1]\n\nOn Battle Cat, my gravel bike, it’s a 1× setup with a 32-tooth chainring on the front and a 11-speed 9–39 e*thirteen XCX cassette on the back. That gives me a solid 0.82 gear ratio on the bottom end of the spectrum and 3.55 on the top end, as well as 10 gear changes with an average gear ratio change of 13.6%.\n\n## Changing things up\n\nDigging into some good combinations of cassette and chain rings, I had two sets of requirements\n1. A closer grouping of the gears on the road bike is desirable but with at least one climbing gear with a gear ratio below 1.\n2. A low climbing gear on the gravel bike is a must given the steep and quite technical terrain I‘m riding more and more often but I also want fairly evenly spaced gears throughout the range, to tackle longer rides across varied terrain more comfortably.\n\nThere‘s an incredible amount of choice in the market for realising what I wanted on both bikes but in all cases I found out that a 2× (double chainring) setup was probably the only way to get there.\n\nMost cyclists know or have heard that a 2×11 setup typically offers 14 unique gears. This can vary depending on the choice of  chainrings and cassette in the back. I‘ve compared a lot of cassettes and chainring combinations using a nifty little online gear calculation tool by [Jürgen Berkemeier](https://www.j-berkemeier.de/Ritzelrechner.html); everything from the e*thirteen and Shimano cassettes I have at home to options from SRAM, Sunrace, Garbaruk, KCNC, etc.\n\nSimilarly, I looked at various double chainring options, ranging from insane 53/38 to the 46/36 I still have on my Rotor 3D30 crankset to 46/30. Most of those combinations when paired with almost any cassette end up giving me 14 unique gears, a few give me 15 and even fewer only 13.\nInterestingly, depending on the difference in teeth between the big and small chainrings, I‘ve seen cassette + double-chainrings combinations where the shift from big to small or small to big chainring (and compensating in the rear) results in a 2%–4% gear ratio increase. I‘d consider this barely usable, which means that these combinations really only offer 14 instead of 15 or 13 instead of 14 unique and usable gears.\n\n## Now here‘s the funny bit.\n\n46/30 chainrings are the only ones I found that, paired with the right cassette in the back, end up with 15 proper, unique gears and a change from the small to the big front ring (again while compensating 3 gears on the cassette), results in an actually usable jump of 7%–9%.  \nI checked other variations of 16-tooth difference chainrings but none seemed to work out with such a high gear ratio increase.[^2]\n\nIt gets even funnier looking at the cassettes. Only two cassettes I‘ve found, have cog size spacing that results in 15 proper gears:\n* Shimano CS-R8000 11–32\n* Shimano CS-M8000 11–40\n\n## What now?\n\nI‘m going back to 2× on both my bikes. – ***GASP!***\n\nPanthor is going to receive a 46/30 chainring coupled with the 11–32 cassette. This gets me a gear ratio of 0.9375 in the lowest and 4.18 in the highest gear and and average gear ratio change of 10.11%, a reduction of ~ 3.6%. This average value may not sound like too much but looking at the gear ratio changes across the current 11 and soon 14 shifts, it‘s substantially closer gearing that‘ll give me a much more consistent cadence.\n\nBattle Cat will also get a 46/30 chainring connected to a 12–40 cassette.[^3] The low gear will offer a ratio of 0.75—*WOOOOO! Insane climbs here I come!*—and the high gear is going to have a value of 3.83, which is plenty. The average gear ratio value will be ~ 11% (down from 13.6%) across 14 gear changes (up from 10).\n\nI’m not sure how long this is going to stick, if I like the setups for riding, and to a lesser degree from a visual perspective – vanity in cycling is a thing, y‘know.  \nThankfully I still have a set of Ultegra R8000 brake shifters and an Ultegra R800 front derailleur at home. The remaining parts like the new chainrings for both bikes were fairly easily found. The Rotor 46/30 direct-mount chainrings are already here and the Easton Gravel Rings, the left GRX brake shifter and the second front derailleur should be here by the end of the week.\n\nLooking forward to the tinkering and trying these two new setups.\n\n[^1]: Quick foot note: the reason the road bike has such a very unusual setup for now, is because it‘s also my shopping and commuter bike, that I sometimes pull my dog in a trailer in. Now not only my needs and wants are shifting, I‘ve also become a stronger cyclist over the past few months.

It replaced a Shimano XT CS-M8000 11–40 cassette that I’ve ridden for over a year and countless of kilometres. These are my first impressions of the cassette.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ntZjB3m/0/X3/i-ntZjB3m-X3.jpg\" alt=\"e\\*thirteen XCX Plus 9-39 cassette and a Shimano RD-RX800 rear derailleur on a titanium bike\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shifting is crisper but a bit more fiddly to set up. I don’t know if it’s the higher number of shift gates or the tooth profile but it took me a while to get shifting right on the bike stand. The cassette would react more quickly to less than optimal indexing. Once tuned properly, I found that it shifts quicker, even under load, and the shift action feels more positive.</li>\n<li>It’s louder. Not to the point where it annoys me but it took a bit of getting used to. I assume the lightweight construction with the large hollow space amplifies chain noise and shifting sounds.</li>\n<li>The cassette feels solid and it has yet to show any signs of wear.</li>\n<li>Chain wrap on the 9-tooth cog doesn’t seem to be an issue. I had read this in a couple of places and was worried that going with such a small cog for the highest gear could cause chain skipping but I’ve not had a problem. Mind you, I’m using a Ultegra RD-RX800 rear derailleur and a Shimano 105 11-speed chain (didn’t want to put on a fresh Ultegra chain, just yet) and I’ve properly adjusted the B-screw tension. Even going full-bore on a flat section, putting as much power as I can into it, hasn’t caused any problems (more on that further down).</li>\n<li>With the chain on the smallest cog and depending on the chainring used up front (32-tooth and 36-tooth for my bicycles), the chain will be very close to the rear end of the chain stay. Depending on the bike, this may not fit at all. On my Litespeed T5G, I’ve noticed some chain slap going down fast and bumpy descents in the 9-tooth cog, even with a clutch rear derailleur. This is something I’ve never experienced with the 11-tooth cog on the XT cassette and it may be a deal breaker for some.</li>\n<li>Lastly, and this is not something I’d ever see myself write: it’s noticeably lighter than the cassette it replaced. Sure, ~ 100 g might not sound like much to a less experienced cyclist such as myself but the back wheel seems just a bit more nimble, riding across bumpy gravel tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all I’m happy with the cassette so far. It’s done exactly what I had hoped it would when converting my bike from a 2× 11 to a 1×11 system. With a 32-tooth chainring up front, the 9–39 spread in the back gives me an ample gear range, an easy 0.82 gear ratio in the lowest gear, a reasonably fast 3.55 gear ratio in the highest gear, and fairly tight and even gear spacing, particularly in the higher gears.</p>\n<p>In fact, I’ve been so happy with this piece of kit that I bought an e*thirteen cassette for my city/commuter/road bike that has, up until recently, sported a full SRAM NX Eagle group with a 11–50 cassette and a 32-tooth chainring.  I replaced the NX Eagle cassette with the <a href=\"https://www.ethirteen.com/products/trs-plus-12-speed-cassette\">2nd generation TRS Plus 12-speed 9–46 cassette</a> and the front chainring with a 36-tooth (soon 38-tooth).</p>\n<p>Based on my initial experiences with the 9–39 on my gravel bike, what drew me to the 9–46 12-speed was <strong>a)</strong> the lower weight, <strong>b)</strong> the greater range of 511% on the e*thirteen compared to 455% on the NX Eagle, while at the same time offering <strong>c)</strong> a much tighter and, in my eyes, more sensible gear spacing in the higher gears. The first six gears on the TRS Plus cassette are <em>9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18</em> where on the NX Eagle the jumps are <em>11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22</em>. My first road ride with the new cassette was a 45 km trip mostly on the road up a local mountain and then down again and I very quickly appreciated the choices made by e*thirteen.<br>\nFinally, chain wrap on the 9-tooth cog is perfectly fine with a SRAM Eagle rear derailleur and a GX Eagle chain. I tried a couple of times to produce any kind of skipping, riding at 80 rpm, on a slight incline, pushing 42 km/h (yes, I was very much winded after) and I experienced no issues whatsoever.</p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to many more kilometres with these cassettes and I’ll write a long term review at a later point.</p>\n",

Sure, ~ 100 g might not sound like much to a less experienced cyclist such as myself but the back wheel seems just a bit more nimble, riding across bumpy gravel tracks.\n\nAll in all I’m happy with the cassette so far. It’s done exactly what I had hoped it would when converting my bike from a 2× 11 to a 1×11 system. With a 32-tooth chainring up front, the 9–39 spread in the back gives me an ample gear range, an easy 0.82 gear ratio in the lowest gear, a reasonably fast 3.55 gear ratio in the highest gear, and fairly tight and even gear spacing, particularly in the higher gears.\n\nIn fact, I’ve been so happy with this piece of kit that I bought an e\\*thirteen cassette for my city/commuter/road bike that has, up until recently, sported a full SRAM NX Eagle group with a 11–50 cassette and a 32-tooth chainring.  I replaced the NX Eagle cassette with the [2nd generation TRS Plus 12-speed 9–46 cassette](https://www.ethirteen.com/products/trs-plus-12-speed-cassette) and the front chainring with a 36-tooth (soon 38-tooth).\n\nBased on my initial experiences with the 9–39 on my gravel bike, what drew me to the 9–46 12-speed was **a)** the lower weight, **b)** the greater range of 511% on the e\\*thirteen compared to 455% on the NX Eagle, while at the same time offering **c)** a much tighter and, in my eyes, more sensible gear spacing in the higher gears. The first six gears on the TRS Plus cassette are *9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18* where on the NX Eagle the jumps are *11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22*. My first road ride with the new cassette was a 45 km trip mostly on the road up a local mountain and then down again and I very quickly appreciated the choices made by e\\*thirteen.  \nFinally, chain wrap on the 9-tooth cog is perfectly fine with a SRAM Eagle rear derailleur and a GX Eagle chain. I tried a couple of times to produce any kind of skipping, riding at 80 rpm, on a slight incline, pushing 42 km/h (yes, I was very much winded after) and I experienced no issues whatsoever.\n\nI’m looking forward to many more kilometres with these cassettes and I’ll write a long term review at a later point.\n",

				"title": "Fujifilm just announced my next camera, the X100V (ARGH!)",
				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday Fujifilm announced a few new things at their &ldquo;X Summit&rdquo; in London. The most consequential one for me was the announcement of the X100V. It&rsquo;s the fifth generation of the X100 series and it&rsquo;s going to be my next camera.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been in love with the concept of the X100 series since shortly after I started shooting with Fujifilm APS-C cameras but it always had too many crucial drawbacks for me to consider actually buying one.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-lens\">The lens</h4>\n<p>The first lens I bought for my X-E1 way back when, was the <a href=\"https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/\">XF23mmF1.4 R</a>. I purchased it because after inspecting the photos I had taken with the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM kit lens, I saw that most of my shots were in the 22–24 mm range and I wanted something with a wider aperture to play around with. The 23/1.4 is still the lens I shoot with the most. I absolutely love it.</p>\n<p>The lens in the X100 series, while decent, simply didn&rsquo;t have the same versatility. Corner sharpness wasn&rsquo;t very good at f/2 and shooting at close focus distances wide open resulted in very soft pictures. Coming from the XF23mmF1.4 R, that&rsquo;s simply not something I would be able to accept.</p>\n<p>(As a side note, the same drawbacks of the X100 lens also apply to the XF23mmF2 R WR lens, albeit not in the severity as found in the X100 series lenses up until now.

				"content_text": "Yesterday Fujifilm announced a few new things at their \"X Summit\" in London. The most consequential one for me was the announcement of the X100V. It's the fifth generation of the X100 series and it's going to be my next camera.\n\nI've been in love with the concept of the X100 series since shortly after I started shooting with Fujifilm APS-C cameras but it always had too many crucial drawbacks for me to consider actually buying one.\n\n#### The lens\n\nThe first lens I bought for my X-E1 way back when, was the [XF23mmF1.4 R](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf23mmf14_r/). I purchased it because after inspecting the photos I had taken with the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM kit lens, I saw that most of my shots were in the 22–24 mm range and I wanted something with a wider aperture to play around with. The 23/1.4 is still the lens I shoot with the most. I absolutely love it.\n\nThe lens in the X100 series, while decent, simply didn't have the same versatility. Corner sharpness wasn't very good at f/2 and shooting at close focus distances wide open resulted in very soft pictures. Coming from the XF23mmF1.4 R, that's simply not something I would be able to accept.\n\n(As a side note, the same drawbacks of the X100 lens also apply to the XF23mmF2 R WR lens, albeit not in the severity as found in the X100 series lenses up until now. It's the reason why I sold the lens again after having used it for a few months.)\n\n#### Weather sealing\n\nI can't begin to say how much I appreciate this on my Fujifilm cameras. I have it on the X-Pro2, on the X-T3, and I had it on the X-T1. I take a camera with me almost everywhere I go in any weather. Be it for a trip downtown or going hiking with my dogs. The cameras and weather sealed lenses have handled everything I've thrown at them so far and I had hoped Fujifilm would've added this to the X100F already, but no.\n\nNow, the new X100V is properly weather sealed once you put a protective filter on the lens and that gives you an extremely compact package that you can take anywhere.\n\n#### Flippy screen\n\nMaybe you like it maybe you don't, I like having it and dislike not having it on the X-Pro2. To get this in a camera as small as the X100V is just a nice bonus that only increases the camera's usefulness.\n\n---\nAfter the announcement, I read the excellent [preview written by Jonas Rask](https://jonasraskphotography.com/2020/02/04/fujifilm-x100v-first-look-preview-the-desert-island-camera/) and immediately knew that it would be very hard to pass up on the X100V. \n\nThen the first review by Chris and Jordan of DPReview TV was published and that completely sealed the deal. It's worth a watch.\n\n{{< youtube wRzsKMUXJNk >}}\n\n---\n_An observation regarding Fujifilm's product policy_\n\nChris Nichols and Jordan Drake mentioned something interesting in the video. Fujifilm has put almost all features found in the very recently released X-Pro3 into the X100V. More than you'd typically expect for what is essentially a compact large-sensor camera. Even the video features are solid for the most part.  \nThis really made me happy because it shows that Fujifilm is essentially following Apple's (and particularly Steve Jobs's playbook) for positioning and releasing products:  \nInstead of artificially separating their product lines to prevent cannibalisation, by limiting the feature sets compared to the flagship products, they let their products cannibalise themselves instead of letting products by other manufacturers do so.\nThis creates true choice for customers and—to me—is a sign of respect for the customers by the company.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>On Wednesday, in an attempt to make good use of the surprisingly sunny weather, I took my gravel bike out for a first ride with the <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/nano-40c\">WTB Nano 40</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/2019/11/13/mm-my-beautiful.html\">My recent experiment of using 650b × 47 mm tyres on my bike</a> failed due to tyre rub on the left chain stay, yes, but it gave me a taste of what wider, higher-volume tyres with an aggressive tread could do for riding gravel and some tame singletrack. So after doing some research on 700×40c rubber, I had high hopes for the WTB NANO 40.</p>\n<p>(I set up the tyres tubeless with <a href=\"https://muc-off.com/products/no-puncture-hassle-tubeless-sealant\">Muc-Off&rsquo;s No Puncture Hassle Tubeless Sealant</a> and inflated them to 37 psi up front and 38 psi in the back referencing the handy <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/en/tirepressure/\">tubeless tire pressure\nrecommendations published by ENVE</a>.)</p>\n<p>For this outing I put together a 20 km route that I had ridden before, at least in parts, comprised of fire roads, some root-y singletrack, a few fast descents on what I thought was going to be either fire roads or well-worn foot paths.

				"content_text": "On Wednesday, in an attempt to make good use of the surprisingly sunny weather, I took my gravel bike out for a first ride with the [WTB Nano 40](https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/nano-40c).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2019/b7f188e8fb.jpg\" alt=\"Wtb NANO 40 on DT Swiss CR1600 Spline db 23 wheels in the forest\" title=\"wtb_nano_40-on-dt_swiss_wheel.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1280\" />\n\n[My recent experiment of using 650b × 47 mm tyres on my bike](https://www.mangochutney.me/2019/11/13/mm-my-beautiful.html) failed due to tyre rub on the left chain stay, yes, but it gave me a taste of what wider, higher-volume tyres with an aggressive tread could do for riding gravel and some tame singletrack. So after doing some research on 700×40c rubber, I had high hopes for the WTB NANO 40.\n\n(I set up the tyres tubeless with [Muc-Off's No Puncture Hassle Tubeless Sealant](https://muc-off.com/products/no-puncture-hassle-tubeless-sealant) and inflated them to 37 psi up front and 38 psi in the back referencing the handy [tubeless tire pressure \nrecommendations published by ENVE](https://www.enve.com/en/tirepressure/).)\n\nFor this outing I put together a 20 km route that I had ridden before, at least in parts, comprised of fire roads, some root-y singletrack, a few fast descents on what I thought was going to be either fire roads or well-worn foot paths. The bad news is that some of the paths had been shut down years ago and were very much overgrown and hard to navigate, the good news is that I was not only able to try the NANO 40 on loose, muddy, sloshy, puddle-dotted forest roads, I was also treated to a crazy fast descent on a 3 km hard pack and relatively dry gravel road.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2019/77c55c278f.jpg\" alt=\"Ride on 20191120\" title=\"ride-on-20191120.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1074\" height=\"1074\" />\n\nAfter finishing the ride, I was left with two dominant feelings from this first experience with the NANO 40:\n\n1.

The core part of the interview concerns the new 16&quot; MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple&rsquo;s butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller&rsquo;s answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, that&rsquo;s not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we&rsquo;ll go down that path.</p>\n<p>iPad benefits because we assume that you need to be able to do most everything with touch, and we don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that experience.

				"content_html": "<p>A couple of weeks ago I had the idea to buy a second wheel set for Battle Cat, my gravel bike, to expand the where I can ride it. The plan was to keep the 700c wheel set I’ve been riding for the past two years for longer gravel rides or for road riding (using road tyres, obviously). I would then buy a 650b/27.5” wheel set and a pair of wider tyres with more bite to venture into more gnarly terrain.</p>\n<p>I inquired with the frame manufacturer what tyre width would be safe to use in the frame and set out to find a good, used wheel set from DT Swiss because I’ve had nothing but great experiences with these so far. After being told that 1.9“ or 4.83 cm wide tyres should work and still provide enough clearance, I quickly settled on the <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/sendero\">WTB Sendero 650b × 47 mm</a> pneus.</p>\n<p>The result was this sexy setup:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The wheel set I found was an older pair DT Swiss M1700 MTB wheels with a decent internal rim width and the Ratchet Free Hub System. There was a bit of a setback when I found out that the last person to service the hind wheel didn’t just fail to remove a massive radial run-out, they also centred the rim over the hub body and not over the axle, resulting in a rim that was too far on the left. After getting this fixed for a good amount of money, putting the tyres on tubeless and the wheels into the frame, I saw that it was a tight fit but doable with no tyre rub on the frame or fork.</p>\n<p>Well, that changed after the first 15 km of singletrack riding on Saturday. I pushed the tyres the way you would and to my great dismay, they expanded/deformed in a way that caused tyre rub on the left chain stay twice in one revolution on a perfectly true back wheel.</p>\n<p>What I’m left with is the choice to either sell the wheel set and tyres again or to find slightly smaller but equally gnarly tyres for the wheels. The problem here, of course, is that smaller tyres also mean an even smaller wheel diameter and a further lowering of the bottom bracket, something that already took getting used to going from 700×40c to 584×47c on the Litespeed T5 Gravel frame I&rsquo;m riding.</p>\n<p>There’s one silver lining to all of this, albeit a fact that left me with a very substantial urge to slam my head into my desk repeatedly because I could&rsquo;ve saved myself the trouble of buying another wheel set:<br>\nI started checking out which 700×40c rubber is available that would give me better grip on wet forest floor than the Donnelly X&rsquo;Plor MSO I love so much. I found a number of options, the <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/products/nano-40c\">WTB Nano 40 </a> being the supposed best among them when set up tubeless. The only issue is that WTB recommends running these tyres on a rim with at least 20 mm internal width and my [DT Swiss CR1600 Spline db](DT Swiss - CR 1600 SPLINE® 23) wheels are 22 mm wide externally … … … or so I thought.<br>\nTurns Out ™ I had misread the specs of the wheels because the spec sheet of the bike I bought them on didn&rsquo;t specify whether the 22 mm were internal or external width figures. Long story short, they have an internal width of 22 mm, meaning they are right in the goldilocks zone width not just for the WTB Nano 40 but for many other ~ 40 mm wide, supple gravel tyres.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m likely going to try and get my hands on the Nanos if I can find them for a decent price and maybe, just maybe I&rsquo;ll get my wish of a gravel bike capable of some gnarlier paths but still fast when I need it to be.</p>\n<p>Goodbye 650b wheels, I hardly knew ye.</p>\n",

After being told that 1.9“ or 4.83 cm wide tyres should work and still provide enough clearance, I quickly settled on the [WTB Sendero 650b × 47 mm](https://www.wtb.com/collections/gravel-cx/products/sendero) pneus.\n\nThe result was this sexy setup:\n\n<img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-cBcFvv7/0/X4/i-cBcFvv7-X4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"My gravel bike Battle Cat with 650b wheels and WTB Sendero tyres\" />\n\nThe wheel set I found was an older pair DT Swiss M1700 MTB wheels with a decent internal rim width and the Ratchet Free Hub System. There was a bit of a setback when I found out that the last person to service the hind wheel didn’t just fail to remove a massive radial run-out, they also centred the rim over the hub body and not over the axle, resulting in a rim that was too far on the left. After getting this fixed for a good amount of money, putting the tyres on tubeless and the wheels into the frame, I saw that it was a tight fit but doable with no tyre rub on the frame or fork.\n\nWell, that changed after the first 15 km of singletrack riding on Saturday. I pushed the tyres the way you would and to my great dismay, they expanded/deformed in a way that caused tyre rub on the left chain stay twice in one revolution on a perfectly true back wheel.\n\nWhat I’m left with is the choice to either sell the wheel set and tyres again or to find slightly smaller but equally gnarly tyres for the wheels. The problem here, of course, is that smaller tyres also mean an even smaller wheel diameter and a further lowering of the bottom bracket, something that already took getting used to going from 700×40c to 584×47c on the Litespeed T5 Gravel frame I'm riding.\n\nThere’s one silver lining to all of this, albeit a fact that left me with a very substantial urge to slam my head into my desk repeatedly because I could've saved myself the trouble of buying another wheel set:  \nI started checking out which 700×40c rubber is available that would give me better grip on wet forest floor than the Donnelly X'Plor MSO I love so much. I found a number of options, the [WTB Nano 40 ](https://www.wtb.com/products/nano-40c) being the supposed best among them when set up tubeless. The only issue is that WTB recommends running these tyres on a rim with at least 20 mm internal width and my [DT Swiss CR1600 Spline db](DT Swiss - CR 1600 SPLINE® 23) wheels are 22 mm wide externally … … … or so I thought.  \nTurns Out ™ I had misread the specs of the wheels because the spec sheet of the bike I bought them on didn't specify whether the 22 mm were internal or external width figures. Long story short, they have an internal width of 22 mm, meaning they are right in the goldilocks zone width not just for the WTB Nano 40 but for many other ~ 40 mm wide, supple gravel tyres.\n\nI'm likely going to try and get my hands on the Nanos if I can find them for a decent price and maybe, just maybe I'll get my wish of a gravel bike capable of some gnarlier paths but still fast when I need it to be.\n\nGoodbye 650b wheels, I hardly knew ye.\n",

There are a number of options, but none of them have had particularly good reviews – at least not judging by what I was able to find.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I just cancelled my Amazon Prime membership.</p><p>As for so many other people, using Amazon's consumer facing services has started to leave a bad taste in my mouth, seeing how atrociously they treat warehouse staff, the negative impact their business has on the delivery drivers of various logistics companies, and the myriad of other small or large bad things this company is doing or is complicit in because it makes them money.</p><p>A few weeks ago I received an email telling me that the credit card Amazon had on file for Prime membership payments was no longer valid and to update the payment settings lest I want to lose my Prime benefits by 12 January 2019.<br>The holidays gave me some time to think about how many of Amazon's services I use daily and consciously and I found that it was too many. Ignoring Amazon services I use by proxy, like AWS servers, here goes:</p><ul><li>Amazon.de and Amazon Marketplace for shopping</li><li>Amazon Prime for fast shipping</li><li>Amazon Prime Video for streaming</li><li>Amazon Kindle for reading ebooks</li><li>Amazon's Audible for audio books.</li></ul><p>With cancelling my Amazon Prime membership, I'm losing access to Prime shipping and Prime Video. Since I've started reducing the amount of things I buy on or through Amazon about a year ago, the former isn't too much of a loss for me. When streaming through Amazon Prime, my partner and I have used her Prime account anyway, so there's no loss for me there, either, until she makes a decision regarding her Amazon Prime account. This could happen sooner rather than later because we use Netflix much more than Prime Video.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how easy it'll be eschewing shopping on Amazon.de entirely and choosing different online shops but I'm not worried about this. The more difficult task will be finding proper replacements for getting ebooks comfortably and finding a good ereader for them. Finding a replacement for Audible will be similarly difficult. And with the latter two there's also the problem of DRM for the things I've already bought on the platforms.</p>\n",

Leider sind viele Strecken auf Komoot eher für Mountainbikes ausgelegt und mit einem ungefederten CX-Rad kommt man da häufig weder gut rauf, noch gesund runter (selbst, wenn ich als Streckentyp &quot;Fahrrad mit Schotter&quot; angebe).</p>\n<p>Ich bastele mir also seit einiger Zeit so meine eigenen Touren und teile hier meine erste, fertige Tour. Sie verbringt viel Zeit auf Schotterpfaden, Waldautobahnen, in den Weinbergen, und unbefestigten Wegen im Wald. Außerdem gibt es am Anfang/Ende einen richtig hübschen Anstieg den Petrisberg hoch. Start- und Endpunkt ist das Restaurant &quot;Jahreszeiten&quot; am Turm Luxemburg, in dem ich immer wieder gerne einkehre.</p>\n<p>Viel Spaß!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.komoot.de/tour/51698725/embed?profile=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n",

The cufflinks of the abuser have the GOP's elephant on them.</p>\n<p>I think this is an amazing piece of political satire, absolute genius. I'm German, I live in Germany, I'm only indirectly affected by what happens over there but the proceedings of last week, which were hard to ignore even over here, had me speechless so many times.<br>\nTo me, it's inconceivable that the GOP props up a man for the highest judicial position in the country, who has had a number of credible accusations of sexual assault, and testimony of character leveled against him, that absolutely disqualifies him not just for the Supreme Court but for any position in the judicial system. And that doesn't even cover the frankly insane and disgraceful performance before the Judicial Committee which betrays a deep disdain for the rule of law, hatred towards women, and shows a complete lack of capacity for impartiality.</p>\n<p>It's sad that U.S. politics is at a point where the Republicans, who have long been a danger to the U.S.A., are now willing to risk the last shred of independence of the Supreme Court to push through their agenda of hate, misogyny, homophobia, and shameless pursuit of power over other people, all of it driven by nothing but greed.</p>\n<p>The fear that if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, the U.S. will deteriorate into an autocracy even faster, is very real and I sincerely hope that the people of the U.S. realise this and stand up before it is too late.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sidenote\">Side note:</h3>\n<p>This morning I read about an interesting case the Supreme Court is going to decide very soon: <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gamble-v-united-states/\">\"Gamble vs. US\"</a><br>\nSome people on Twitter argued that the true reason the GOP and Trump want to push Kavanaugh into a SCOTUS seat, is so he can rule on the above case.<br>\nAt its core, the lawsuit is about a weapon possessions charge and whether a defendant can be tried for the same charge by both state and federal authorities (so called \"double jeopardy\"). <a href=\"https://www.democraticunderground.com/100211211624\">Several people argue that</a> a decision to prevent state and federal authorities from prosecuting someone for the same crime, could mean that a federal pardon from Trump, might prevent state authorities from prosecuting a person and would thus minimise the pressure state prosecutors can put on defendants in cases linked to Trump.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When writing about gear, I typically try to limit myself to solutions for problems I faced, or some New Shiny™ that really piqued my interest. This is an exception. It's an ode to my favourite lens.</p>\n<p>Half a year after having started shooting with a Fujifilm X-E1 and the XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM OIS kit lens, I was considering buying a lens with a wide aperture for greater creative freedom. I checked which focal length I used most often and at the time ~ 75% of the shots I kept were somewhere around 23 mm (~ 35 mm full-frame equivalent) leading me to buy the <a href=\"http://fujifilm-x.com/de/lenses/xf23mmf14-r/\">Fujifilm XF23mmF1.4 R</a>.</p>\n<p>I won't lose too many words about the overall quality of this lens. Many people have done so before me and most of them have a lot more experience with photography and gear than I do. The focal length is versatile, the build quality and the overall image quality are great. Placing the field of focus is easy, and considering the amount of glass that has to be moved, it focuses quickly enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-K2CCjSK/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/75b06aa1e8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I absolutely love about the 23/1.4, is the fact that it's so boring, so predictable, so utterly unspectacular. In other words, it's dependable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two characteristics that influence the dependability and predictability of the lens the most are sharpness and the way it makes out-of-focus areas look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharpness\">Sharpness</h3>\n<p>Even wide open, the lens renders sharp pictures across ~ 70% of the frame from the center. More importantly, though, this doesn't change based on the subject distance. I can shoot close-ups at ƒ/1.4 and be sure that the center of the frame is going to be tack sharp while anything behind it ends up an unrecognisable blur. When shooting landscapes in waining light at the widest aperture, I know that the result is still going to be good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-kCgZ4kc/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/3f9b6ce91c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"renderingoftheoutoffocusareas\">Rendering of the out-of-focus areas</h3>\n<p>Many great lenses can also be capricious at times, where the way the out-of-focus areas are rendered can vary wildly depending on the subject distance and aperture and lead to less than desirable results sometimes, like overly busy looking backgrounds. The XF23mmF1.4 R delivers absolutely consistent results that take a lot of guesswork out of taking pictures. I choose my subject, the distance and angle, and pick the aperture I want.<br>\nFurthermore, the progression from sharp to blurry moving from the in-focus subject to the background feels almost linear (depending on the composition). The same holds true for aperture changes from ƒ/1.4 to ƒ/8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aghoffmann.net/Favoriten/i-9FrSDM3/A\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2021/1dbdb7a73a.jpg\" alt=\"Mika's front paws\"></a></p>\n<p>If I could improve one aspect about the 23/1.4, it would be the addition of weather sealing. As one of the older optics in Fujifilm's line-up, it's not sealed against the elements.<br>\nUnfortunately the smaller, lighter, and weather-sealed XF23mmF2 R WR is no viable alternative. Its image quality is great but the rendering characteristics aren't nearly as predictable or dependable, making the lens less versatile.</p>\n<p>Even so, the XF23mmF1.4 R is the lens I would take to a deserted island with me, the glass I would choose if I had to go with one lens for the rest of my days.</p>\n",
