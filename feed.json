If she wanted to use that one, she'd have to modify the strap and shorten it by about 20 cm.\n\nThe Restrap can be cinched down to fit her hips at least but the way the straps attach to the body leave the top half of it always dangling and rocking, creating discomfort and instability. Oh and the padding of the hip belt is very oddly cut so it digs into her hips. \n\nThe search continues and my hunch is that she'll have to work with the people from Wizard Works in the UK or someone else for something custom and expensive.\n\n[^1]: For the record: Specialized Diverge Carbon & E5 (aluminium), Cannondale Topstone Carbon & Aluminium, Trek Domane aluminium (and that's not really a gravel bike), Liv Devote.\n",

Plain and simple. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2024/20240202-l1000791.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\nI have a pair of Shimano SH-MW702 GoreTex shoes with a wide toe box for cold/foul weather cycling. Sadly even with thick wool socks, I sometimes got cold feet on longer rides once my feet have become properly sweaty once. \n\nThese liner socks have fixed that for me. Separating out my toes + the effects of layering other socks on top has been amazing. It's easier to pick the right combination of socks depending on the conditions I'm going to be riding in and I often opt for a thinner pair of wool socks on top of these liners and bring a thicker pair with me on longer rides in the cold in case I've misjudged the temperatures.\n",

I really liked these tires: they punch far above their weight and lasted a long time.</p>\n<p>The type of rubber I wanted to go with next needed to be lighter, faster, potentially narrower (for those all-important and marginal Aero Gains™) but still robust enough to survive excursions onto field and forest roads that I enjoy on my rides</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-mondo-2bliss-ready-t2t5/p/1000161296?color=1000161298-1000161296\">Specialized S-Works Mondo</a> piqued my interest when I saw the announcement and after reading a review on <a href=\"https://www.rennrad-news.de/news/s-works-mondo-rennrad-reifen-test/\">Rennrad News</a> and a first look on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-s-works-mondo-tires-and-romin-evo-pro-mirror-saddle/\">Bikerumor</a>, I decided to give them a try.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mounting\">Mounting</h2>\n<p>I bought the 700×28c version planning on running them with Schwalbe Aerothan tubes.

I really liked these tires: they punch far above their weight and lasted a long time.\n\nThe type of rubber I wanted to go with next needed to be lighter, faster, potentially narrower (for those all-important and marginal Aero Gains™) but still robust enough to survive excursions onto field and forest roads that I enjoy on my rides\n\nThe [Specialized S-Works Mondo](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-mondo-2bliss-ready-t2t5/p/1000161296?color=1000161298-1000161296) piqued my interest when I saw the announcement and after reading a review on [Rennrad News](https://www.rennrad-news.de/news/s-works-mondo-rennrad-reifen-test/) and a first look on [Bikerumor](https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-s-works-mondo-tires-and-romin-evo-pro-mirror-saddle/), I decided to give them a try. \n\n## Mounting \n\nI bought the 700×28c version planning on running them with Schwalbe Aerothan tubes.

I checked what I had laying around in terms of componentry, made a list of stuff I&rsquo;d need and got searching.<br>\nI have to admit that it did feel like sacrilege swapping all of those perfectly good old components but I&rsquo;m very happy with the result (and I&rsquo;m not giving them away, so if I ever decide to sell the bike again, I&rsquo;ll likely install them again).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>List of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>680 mm wide (25.4 mm clamp diametre) Reserve handlebars (new, stripped the logos)</li>\n<li>Higher stem (bought used)</li>\n<li>Spurcycle bell, black (new – none of my bikes feels complete without one)</li>\n<li>SRAM GX Eagle group + NX Eagle HG cassette (bought used)</li>\n<li>Rotor Aldhu cranks + Rotor oval 34t chainring (bought used and got it surprisingly cheap)</li>\n<li>Magura HS33 hydro rim brakes (new)</li>\n<li>Specialized Pizza Rack (bought used)</li>\n<li>DT Swiss rims (32 spokes, 19 mm internal width) with Shimano XT hubs front and rear (bought used, almost mint condition and got them for a really good price)</li>\n<li>Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700×38c (used) on Tubolito tubes (also used)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bike rides really well and with the very low gearing, lugging the doggy trailer up one of many hills in the area is quite doable.

All original parts were from Trek's in-house accessory brand (before Bontrager) and the groupset was full Shimano STX RC (including the wheels). \n\nI immediately fell in love with this bike and after I picked it up from the seller at Lake Constance, it was fitted with a pair of SKS Bluemels Long fenders and a period-appropriate rear rack.\n\nAfter riding it happily for a few months, I made some changes to my stable of bikes and with some inspiration from The Radavist and Bikepacking.com—typical cyclist, I know—I got it into my head that I could turn this into a retro mod that would be appropriate not only for really quick runs to the supermarket but also for day rides when I don't need one of my more performance-oriented bikes. I checked what I had laying around in terms of componentry, made a list of stuff I'd need and got searching.  \nI have to admit that it did feel like sacrilege swapping all of those perfectly good old components but I'm very happy with the result (and I'm not giving them away, so if I ever decide to sell the bike again, I'll likely install them again).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4828/2022/6f3a087bc6.jpg\" alt=\"Retro-mod of a 1996 Trek MultiTrack rigid trekking MTB with a Croozer dog trailer attached. The bike and trailer are standing on a grassy path alongside a green field, in front of a slightly hazy mountain vista.\">\n\nList of changes:\n\n* 680 mm wide (25.4 mm clamp diametre) Reserve handlebars (new, stripped the logos)\n* Higher stem (bought used)\n* Spurcycle bell, black (new – none of my bikes feels complete without one)\n* SRAM GX Eagle group + NX Eagle HG cassette (bought used)\n* Rotor Aldhu cranks + Rotor oval 34t chainring (bought used and got it surprisingly cheap)\n* Magura HS33 hydro rim brakes (new)\n* Specialized Pizza Rack (bought used)\n* DT Swiss rims (32 spokes, 19 mm internal width) with Shimano XT hubs front and rear (bought used, almost mint condition and got them for a really good price)\n* Specialized Pathfinder Pro 700×38c (used) on Tubolito tubes (also used)\n\nThe bike rides really well and with the very low gearing, lugging the doggy trailer up one of many hills in the area is quite doable. The rims are excellent and braking performance with the HS33 is incredible.\n",

				"title": "Removing Harry Potter from my shelves because J.K. Rowling is a raging TERF",
				"content_html": "<p>Some time two weeks ago, yet another story of the Harry Potter author publicly supporting something hateful aimed at the transgender community was reported on. This finally had me grab all Harry Potter books from my shelves, put them in a cardboard box, tape the box shut and put it away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Mf9LHZH/0/49c32741/X4/i-Mf9LHZH-X4.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Closeup of a wooden bookshelf with the Harry Potter Books in visible in three languages, a Marauder's Map in front of the books, with two wand from the film franchise on top of it. To the right the Knight Bus from the movies in LEGO form and various other bits and pieces of merchandise on top of the books.\"></p>\n<p>The Harry Potter books have meant a lot to me. I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve read them or listened to the Stephen Fry-narrated audiobooks. Hell, the books became so familiar to me that I bought them in various languages to aid me in learning. The franchise has been a point of connection with a number of friends. References from and memes based on content from the books and movies will be forever burned into my brain.</p>\n<p>But over the past few years, I found it hard to look at the books without a painful pang, robbing me of the joy I typically felt when thinking of the stories. The author&rsquo;s decision to propagate transphobia has tainted my relationship with the Harry Potter books for a long time, and it was, in all honesty, mixed with a fair amount of shame because I didn&rsquo;t catch <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it\">the various bits of transphobic drivel in her Cormoran Strike novels</a>, at a time where I had believed myself to be more sensitive to those topics already.</p>\n<p>For the longest time, I didn&rsquo;t quite understand why that was, why I wasn&rsquo;t able to separate Rowling from Harry Potter, when I&rsquo;ve separated the art from the artist in other cases.

				"content_text": "Some time two weeks ago, yet another story of the Harry Potter author publicly supporting something hateful aimed at the transgender community was reported on. This finally had me grab all Harry Potter books from my shelves, put them in a cardboard box, tape the box shut and put it away. \n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Mf9LHZH/0/49c32741/X4/i-Mf9LHZH-X4.jpg \"Closeup of a wooden bookshelf with the Harry Potter Books in visible in three languages, a Marauder's Map in front of the books, with two wand from the film franchise on top of it. To the right the Knight Bus from the movies in LEGO form and various other bits and pieces of merchandise on top of the books.\")\n\nThe Harry Potter books have meant a lot to me. I don't know how many times I've read them or listened to the Stephen Fry-narrated audiobooks. Hell, the books became so familiar to me that I bought them in various languages to aid me in learning. The franchise has been a point of connection with a number of friends. References from and memes based on content from the books and movies will be forever burned into my brain. \n\nBut over the past few years, I found it hard to look at the books without a painful pang, robbing me of the joy I typically felt when thinking of the stories. The author's decision to propagate transphobia has tainted my relationship with the Harry Potter books for a long time, and it was, in all honesty, mixed with a fair amount of shame because I didn't catch [the various bits of transphobic drivel in her Cormoran Strike novels](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeynz/jk-rowlings-transphobia-wasnt-hard-to-find-she-wrote-a-book-about-it), at a time where I had believed myself to be more sensitive to those topics already. \n\nFor the longest time, I didn't quite understand why that was, why I wasn't able to separate Rowling from Harry Potter, when I've separated the art from the artist in other cases. Now I believe I finally got it: \n\nJ.K. Rowling is intentionally, actively, violently transphobic. She uses her gigantic platform to propagate hate and props up others who want to see transgender people hurt and excluded from society. By all appearances she revels in spreading an ideology devoid of tolerance and humanity. \n\nThis, combined with how much I love(d) the Harry Potter franchise, is the reason why I can't continue to blissfully enjoy the books. With Rowling it's not accidental ignorance, it's her desire to cause pain and endanger transgender persons.\n\nI can't expect her to change her behaviour, to stop causing pain, but I can fill the space on the shelf with books from other authors.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-HG4gL3G/0/028076b6/X4/i-HG4gL3G-X4.jpg \"An almost empty wooden bookshelf save for three book by the author Mary Robinette Kowal from her Lady Astronaut series on the left.\")\n",
