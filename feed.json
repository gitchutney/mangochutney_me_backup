The frame set is stiff enough to lend itself to fast road rides, it accelerates quickly, and the steering is towards the more direct side between the Veloheld Icon.X and the full-on 2004 Litespeed Tuscany road bike that I’ve sold a couple of years back. The geometry is bit more upright and comfortable for longer rides (especially combined with some carbon Ritchey handlebars).</p>\n<p>Right now I have a pair of WTB Exposure 30 tyres on it, which plump up to 32 mm on the DT Swiss GRC1600 wheels (hookless with 24.5 mm inner width) and these tyres are really versatile. Great for fast, dry road rides and with a little less pressure they work well enough on mild gravel, too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-LGhDRgw/0/9994b665/4K/i-LGhDRgw-4K.jpg\" alt=\"Forest gravel road flanked by lush green bushes and trees extending into the distance.

I don’t plan on tackling the kinds of rides with it that I have my XC mountain bike for but I’m also not limited to planning routes in Komoot locked in to the „road bike“ category; „bike“ works perfectly fine and I know it won’t throw anything at me that I can’t handle on this bike with slick tyres.</p>\n<p>The frame and fork can take up to a 35 mm wide rubber and I’ve already done a couple of proper gravel rides using DT Swiss CR1600 wheels shod with Schwalbe X-One 33 mm tubeless tyres.

The bike is positioned between two white windows frame in sandstone and two vertically opening lids close to the ground in the wall painted green.\")\n\nAt this point I’ve done 750+ km on the bike and I’m very happy with it. The frame set is stiff enough to lend itself to fast road rides, it accelerates quickly, and the steering is towards the more direct side between the Veloheld Icon.X and the full-on 2004 Litespeed Tuscany road bike that I’ve sold a couple of years back. The geometry is bit more upright and comfortable for longer rides (especially combined with some carbon Ritchey handlebars).\n\nRight now I have a pair of WTB Exposure 30 tyres on it, which plump up to 32 mm on the DT Swiss GRC1600 wheels (hookless with 24.5 mm inner width) and these tyres are really versatile. Great for fast, dry road rides and with a little less pressure they work well enough on mild gravel, too.\n\n![Forest gravel road flanked by lush green bushes and trees extending into the distance.

To the left and right a simple wooden railing sits atop the edges of a canal passing under the gravel road. A titanium gravel bike with dusty slick tyres, photographed from the back, is leaning against the railing on the right.\")\n\nSo far going for an „all road“ bike seems to have been exactly what I was looking for. I don’t plan on tackling the kinds of rides with it that I have my XC mountain bike for but I’m also not limited to planning routes in Komoot locked in to the „road bike“ category; „bike“ works perfectly fine and I know it won’t throw anything at me that I can’t handle on this bike with slick tyres. \n\nThe frame and fork can take up to a 35 mm wide rubber and I’ve already done a couple of proper gravel rides using DT Swiss CR1600 wheels shod with Schwalbe X-One 33 mm tubeless tyres. Now _that_ was a bunch of fun and it’s the setup I plan on using for this year’s [Gravel Rallye Rhine Valley](https://gravel-rallye.com/rhine-valley/).\n\n![Drive side view of a titanium gravel bike leaning against a white and grey house wall.

The bike and saddle bag are dusty from a dry-weather off-road ride.\")\n\nFor many cyclists [n+1](https://road.cc/content/feature/do-you-really-need-another-bike-find-out-what-n1-means-289875) is a reality and I don’t want to claim to be an exception – my stupid brain is already thinking of what fun thing to do with the Veloheld frame set … maybe a flat bar gravel bike? I can honestly say that I’m enjoying this bike more than I would’ve thought possible and something really groundbreaking would have to come along to get me to even think of replacing it.\n",

I'd still love to see John Oliver return every now and then but the roster of people Andy is bringing on from around the world, all of them with their own perspectives, is hard to beat.\r\n\r\nI was introduced to so many extremely funny comics: first and foremost [Alice Fraser](http://www.alicecomedyfraser.com), as well as (and in no particular order) [Tiff Stevenson](https://tiffstevenson.co.uk), [Nish Kumar](https://www.nishkumar.co.uk), [Aditi Mittal](http://aditimittal.com), [Josh Gondleman](http://www.joshgondelman.com), [Anuvab Pal](https://anuvabpal.com), [Charlie George](https://charliegeorgecomedy.com), [James Nokise](https://twitter.com/JamesNokise), [Felicity Ward](https://www.felicityward.com), [Alison Spittle](http://alisonspittle.com), and many, many more.\r\n\r\nThere are alerady two spin-offs, both hosted by Alice Fraser:  \r\n[The Gargle](https://pod.link/Gargle), in which Alice and guests tackle anything that isn't political news, and [The Last Post](https://pod.link/thelastpost), The Bugle from a parallel universe.\r\n\r\nIf you like satire, sillyness, and can handle puns, check out The Bugle and its sister shows. I'll see you again in about 9 months, once you reemerge from the binge cave. 😁\n",

The bicycle frames I have are the right size, from what I can tell.

This in turn caused numbness in my hands, sometimes after only 20–30 min of riding.

I gave it a try, gradually moving the saddle back<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and carefully tilting it forward a bit. This resulted in me rotating my upper body downward and my hip forward.<br>\nI was honestly stunned by how suddenly my core muscles had an easier time supporting my upper body, less weight resting on the hands, and the bike feeling less long even though I technically increased the distance between the nose of my saddle and the handlebars.</p>\n<p>Something was still a little off:</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-saddle-was-too-low\">My saddle was too low</h3>\n<p>This realisation was the single biggest revelation to my riding comfort and equally importantly; my cycling efficiency.</p>\n<p>One of the most commonly used methods to estimate/determine saddle height is the &ldquo;heel method&rdquo;, where you sit squarely on the saddle and place your heel on the pedal, with the leg fully extended. If you cannot extend the leg fully, move the saddle up. If you find that you&rsquo;re rolling of the side of the saddle trying to extend the leg, move the saddle down until you sit securely on the saddle again.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been setting my saddle height using this method for years and it <em>Turns Out™</em> that it doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>\n<p>Looking at a video my partner recorded, I noticed that in the lowest pedal position the underside of my foot was pretty much level with the ground and that the angle of my upper leg to my lower leg was larger than typically recommended.</p>\n<p>After some reading, I discovered two methods for calculating saddle height (see the article linked above) and they gave me totally different numbers than the heel method and a new starting point for experimentation.</p>\n<p>I gradually increased the height of my saddle and ended up with 3 cm more<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.

After having already gone through the two steps above, I still felt some discomfort after a long time in the saddle on the trainer.</p>\n<p>Looking for information, I stumbled across a video on the youtube cycling channel GCN where someone asked for advice with saddle sores/butt pain on a bike trainer. Their guidance was to use a narrower saddle than what one would typically use but obviously something that still supports the sit bones fully, to encourage more movement and better circulation while on a static trainer.</p>\n<p>This bit of advice turned out to be bang-on for me and brought the desired improvement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\">In conclusion</h2>\n<p>Using a bike trainer allowed me to cautiously experiment and eventually massively improve my bike fit. I was lucky in the sense that my bicycles have the right size and my basic assumptions about reach and stem length were correct. Honestly, I should&rsquo;ve gotten a trainer (or better: a proper bike fit) a long time ago.</p>\n<p>Cycling on my bikes now, I&rsquo;m much more relaxed, able to put much more power down at the same perceived exertion, and long rides are more enjoyable because my bikes feel more comfortable.<br>\nOn the gravel bike in tricky terrain there has been another positive side effect: due to the fact that I&rsquo;m putting less weight onto the handlebars and being in a generally more balanced forward/aft position on the bike, I&rsquo;m able to steer more nimbly. That gives me more confidence on technical climbs and descents and makes for a wildly improved and fun overall riding experience.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Another important part to this whole equation is being able to take videos of yourself on the bike trainer while pedalling (or having someone help you) while you wear tight-fitting clothing.

Their guidance was to use a narrower saddle than what one would typically use but obviously something that still supports the sit bones fully, to encourage more movement and better circulation while on a static trainer.\n\nThis bit of advice turned out to be bang-on for me and brought the desired improvement.\n\n\n## In conclusion\n\nUsing a bike trainer allowed me to cautiously experiment and eventually massively improve my bike fit. I was lucky in the sense that my bicycles have the right size and my basic assumptions about reach and stem length were correct. Honestly, I should've gotten a trainer (or better: a proper bike fit) a long time ago.\n\nCycling on my bikes now, I'm much more relaxed, able to put much more power down at the same perceived exertion, and long rides are more enjoyable because my bikes feel more comfortable.  \nOn the gravel bike in tricky terrain there has been another positive side effect: due to the fact that I'm putting less weight onto the handlebars and being in a generally more balanced forward/aft position on the bike, I'm able to steer more nimbly. That gives me more confidence on technical climbs and descents and makes for a wildly improved and fun overall riding experience.\n\n[^1]: Another important part to this whole equation is being able to take videos of yourself on the bike trainer while pedalling (or having someone help you) while you wear tight-fitting clothing. It's going to make it easier to check and analyse your riding position.\n[^2]: At this point my saddles are set back about as far as they will go, a 2 cm change from before and I'm contemplating buying seat posts with built-in set back, to try if this will improve things further.\n[^3]: Note that how far up or down you go with your saddle is also influenced by the overall mobility of your hips and lower back and you need to take that into consideration.\n",

				"content_text": "On Saturday, I managed to beat my _innerer Schweinehund_ [^1] to go out for a winter cold/bad weather ride. I had wanted to take Swift Wind on a route I've ridden a number of times since moving to Freiburg, to finally see how it compared to my gravel bike with road tyres.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-GcjrdBJ/0/1d02da79/O/i-GcjrdBJ.jpg \"Strava map of ride on 2020.12.05\")\n\nIt was a good ride for the most part and once again I felt the differences between a true road bike and a road rubber-equipped gravel bike when it comes to, well, riding on the road. The weather was grey, moody, a bit of rain came down, too, and the roads were wet and dirty. Back home Swift Wind looked as dirty as Battle Cat, if you replaced the dirt and mud the latter attracts cycling off road with grime from the street.\n\nThis was also the first wet weather outing with the Mavic Kysrium Pro Exalith wheels and I came away impressed with the stopping power and modulation of the wheel set/brake pad combination.

It’s a 2004—I think—Litespeed Tuscany and it had a mix of Campagnolo Record/Chorus 2×10 components, Zonda G3 &amp; G4 wheels, a 46/36 carbon FSA crankset, and a 13–26 cassette.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pxvLz2S/0/c8260ddf/4K/i-pxvLz2S-4K.jpg\" alt=\"Litespeed Tuscany with Campagnolo components and FSA finishing kit\"></p>\n<p>Hopping on the bike for the first time was a strange feeling. Not only had I never ridden a Campagnolo group<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> before, the geometry was completely off. And I mean … <em>what?</em><br>\nThe previous owner of the bike supposedly is 2 cm shorter than I am and has a 1 cm shorter inseam length. It felt like I was lying on the bike and not sitting on it. My only guess is that the previous owner must have a long torso and long arms. I wasn’t able to do anything about the crazy long reach of the drop bars or the 110 mm stem or the 35 mm setback of the seat post but all of this was going to change anyway.</p>\n<p>I was going to completely dismantle the bike and upgrade the components, mostly with things I still had in my workshop and some which I bought used off classifieds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full mechanical Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset with a 11-speed 11–32 cassette.</li>\n<li>The Easton EA90 crankset with a 46/30 chainring, that I ran on my gravel bike, because I like my legs and the hills here are steep.</li>\n<li>An Easton EA70 seat post and stem. The seat post has no setback and the stem is 70 mm long.</li>\n<li>A Canyon H17 drop bar replaces the very strangely shaped FSA drop bars.</li>\n<li>The Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow saddle that served me on my commuter until then.</li>\n<li>Specialized HD Wrap bar tape.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I searched for a new wheel set, too, but anything that could have be seen as an improvement over the Campagnolo wheels that were already on the bike would’ve made this project unnecessarily expensive. To my utter delight I found that Campagnolo used to make (and maybe still makes) 11-speed Shimano HG free hubs for these old wheel sets and the switch was just as easy as with the DT Swiss wheels that I’ve come to get used to over the past few years. Considering that this wheel set is 14+ years old, I was rather impressed, and really; it looks hella cool.<br>\nThe tyres are Continental Four Seasons in 25 mm and barely show signs of wear, so they’re sticking around, too.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>This past weekend, after I had all components and tools I needed, including a Shimano ISIS bottom bracket removal tool that was kindly lent to me by the owner of a local bike shop, and I began the process of disassembling bike, cleaning everything thoroughly, checking for as of then unseen defects, and putting it back together with new parts.</p>\n<p>The process involved a few neat little bike maintenance firsts for me: shortening a carbon steerer tube, installing a BSA bottom bracket, and setting up modern symmetric dual pivot road bike rim brakes — <em>and there I was thinking properly aligning disc brake pads was fiddly.</em>\nI’ve learned quite a bit and I’m happy about it.</p>\n<p>The end result looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-BmnMwL5/0/9d2e47c8/4K/i-BmnMwL5-4K.jpg\" alt=\"Litespeed Tuscany with Shimano & Easton components, Easton finishing kit, and Campagnolo wheels\"></p>\n<p>I’m still getting used to the horizontal top tube—it kind of betrays the age of the frame—but the first proper ride this morning was gobs of fun. I picked a short but taxing route up a familiar hill with a manageable gradient to see how it climbs and down a proper descent to see how fast it would go.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>During the assembly process, I kept wondering what to call this new bike and it came to me while blasting down the road from St. Peter towards Eschbach: sticking with the „Masters of the Universe“ theme the bike will carry the name „<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Wind\">Swift Wind</a>“.</p>\n<p>The aero bars are coming on over the next few days and I need different pedals for it but I am very much looking forward to all of the riding I’ll be doing with it.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Side note: For a ~ 14 years old group set, shifting is very crisp, akin to the SRAM X01 Eagle group I have on my commuter bike.

I wasn’t able to do anything about the crazy long reach of the drop bars or the 110 mm stem or the 35 mm setback of the seat post but all of this was going to change anyway.\n\nI was going to completely dismantle the bike and upgrade the components, mostly with things I still had in my workshop and some which I bought used off classifieds:\n\n* Full mechanical Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset with a 11-speed 11–32 cassette.\n* The Easton EA90 crankset with a 46/30 chainring, that I ran on my gravel bike, because I like my legs and the hills here are steep.\n* An Easton EA70 seat post and stem. The seat post has no setback and the stem is 70 mm long.\n* A Canyon H17 drop bar replaces the very strangely shaped FSA drop bars.\n* The Fabric Scoop Pro Shallow saddle that served me on my commuter until then.\n* Specialized HD Wrap bar tape.[^2]\n\nI searched for a new wheel set, too, but anything that could have be seen as an improvement over the Campagnolo wheels that were already on the bike would’ve made this project unnecessarily expensive. To my utter delight I found that Campagnolo used to make (and maybe still makes) 11-speed Shimano HG free hubs for these old wheel sets and the switch was just as easy as with the DT Swiss wheels that I’ve come to get used to over the past few years. Considering that this wheel set is 14+ years old, I was rather impressed, and really; it looks hella cool.  \nThe tyres are Continental Four Seasons in 25 mm and barely show signs of wear, so they’re sticking around, too.[^3]\n\nThis past weekend, after I had all components and tools I needed, including a Shimano ISIS bottom bracket removal tool that was kindly lent to me by the owner of a local bike shop, and I began the process of disassembling bike, cleaning everything thoroughly, checking for as of then unseen defects, and putting it back together with new parts.\n\nThe process involved a few neat little bike maintenance firsts for me: shortening a carbon steerer tube, installing a BSA bottom bracket, and setting up modern symmetric dual pivot road bike rim brakes — *and there I was thinking properly aligning disc brake pads was fiddly.* \nI’ve learned quite a bit and I’m happy about it.\n\nThe end result looks like this:\n\n![Litespeed Tuscany with Shimano & Easton components, Easton finishing kit, and Campagnolo wheels](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-BmnMwL5/0/9d2e47c8/4K/i-BmnMwL5-4K.jpg)\n\nI’m still getting used to the horizontal top tube—it kind of betrays the age of the frame—but the first proper ride this morning was gobs of fun. I picked a short but taxing route up a familiar hill with a manageable gradient to see how it climbs and down a proper descent to see how fast it would go.[^4]\n\nDuring the assembly process, I kept wondering what to call this new bike and it came to me while blasting down the road from St. Peter towards Eschbach: sticking with the „Masters of the Universe“ theme the bike will carry the name „[Swift Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Wind)“.\n\nThe aero bars are coming on over the next few days and I need different pedals for it but I am very much looking forward to all of the riding I’ll be doing with it.\n\n[^1]: Side note: For a ~ 14 years old group set, shifting is very crisp, akin to the SRAM X01 Eagle group I have on my commuter bike. Each downshift is accompanied by a solid **thunk** with a very positive lever action. I can understand why these components are still as expensive as they are.\n[^2]: I’ve been using this bar tape on my gravel bike for a long time now and it’s not only very comfortable and grippy, it’s also very forgiving while being applied. For an amateur like me, that’s a blessing.\n[^3]: They’re so skinny compared to the 38 mm–42 mm rubber I’m used to from my gravel bike.\n[^4]: It went fast.\n",

I don’t know if it’s the higher number of shift gates or the tooth profile but it took me a while to get shifting right on the bike stand.

Once tuned properly, I found that it shifts quicker, even under load, and the shift action feels more positive.</li>\n<li>It’s louder.

I had read this in a couple of places and was worried that going with such a small cog for the highest gear could cause chain skipping but I’ve not had a problem. Mind you, I’m using a Ultegra RD-RX800 rear derailleur and a Shimano 105 11-speed chain (didn’t want to put on a fresh Ultegra chain, just yet) and I’ve properly adjusted the B-screw tension. Even going full-bore on a flat section, putting as much power as I can into it, hasn’t caused any problems (more on that further down).</li>\n<li>With the chain on the smallest cog and depending on the chainring used up front (32-tooth and 36-tooth for my bicycles), the chain will be very close to the rear end of the chain stay. Depending on the bike, this may not fit at all. On my Litespeed T5G, I’ve noticed some chain slap going down fast and bumpy descents in the 9-tooth cog, even with a clutch rear derailleur. This is something I’ve never experienced with the 11-tooth cog on the XT cassette and it may be a deal breaker for some.</li>\n<li>Lastly, and this is not something I’d ever see myself write: it’s noticeably lighter than the cassette it replaced. Sure, ~ 100 g might not sound like much to a less experienced cyclist such as myself but the back wheel seems just a bit more nimble, riding across bumpy gravel tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all I’m happy with the cassette so far. It’s done exactly what I had hoped it would when converting my bike from a 2× 11 to a 1×11 system. With a 32-tooth chainring up front, the 9–39 spread in the back gives me an ample gear range, an easy 0.82 gear ratio in the lowest gear, a reasonably fast 3.55 gear ratio in the highest gear, and fairly tight and even gear spacing, particularly in the higher gears.</p>\n<p>In fact, I’ve been so happy with this piece of kit that I bought an e*thirteen cassette for my city/commuter/road bike that has, up until recently, sported a full SRAM NX Eagle group with a 11–50 cassette and a 32-tooth chainring.  I replaced the NX Eagle cassette with the <a href=\"https://www.ethirteen.com/products/trs-plus-12-speed-cassette\">2nd generation TRS Plus 12-speed 9–46 cassette</a> and the front chainring with a 36-tooth (soon 38-tooth).</p>\n<p>Based on my initial experiences with the 9–39 on my gravel bike, what drew me to the 9–46 12-speed was <strong>a)</strong> the lower weight, <strong>b)</strong> the greater range of 511% on the e*thirteen compared to 455% on the NX Eagle, while at the same time offering <strong>c)</strong> a much tighter and, in my eyes, more sensible gear spacing in the higher gears. The first six gears on the TRS Plus cassette are <em>9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18</em> where on the NX Eagle the jumps are <em>11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22</em>.

After failing to take to it in the beginning, I warmed to it when I realised how fast this lens was and how nicely it renders high contrast scenes. It&rsquo;s become my go-to lens for taking pictures when out for walks or hiking with the dog, because I can rely on it focusing quickly on moving subjects and capturing what I see.

				"content_text": "Fujifilm continues to give me reasons to like them.\n\nI started the video expecting to see Chris Nichols report on significant differences in optical performance between the € 199,— XC35mmF2 and the € 399,— XF35mmF2 just because _capitalism_. Sometimes it's nice to be wrong and particularly in this case.\n\n{{< youtube VPBBqS8nEgU >}}\n\nFujifilm is taking the guts of this lens and making it available in an even more affordable package. That is such a great move because it gives a customer the option to decide if they want to spend money on weather sealing and a full metal build without having to compromise on optical quality or autofocus speed.\n\nI have the XF35mmF2 R WR. After failing to take to it in the beginning, I warmed to it when I realised how fast this lens was and how nicely it renders high contrast scenes. It's become my go-to lens for taking pictures when out for walks or hiking with the dog, because I can rely on it focusing quickly on moving subjects and capturing what I see. Then there's the focal length that, while a bit tighter than I typically like, lends itself well for the types of outdoor portraits that I like to shoot.

This is certainly a more ambitious project and less likely to ever become a viable product compared to the dual screen laptop Concept Duet. After reading and watching the coverage of this early stage concept, I can't help but hope that it won't stay just a concept but become a real thing. I've been playing _Star Wars – Jedi: Fallen Order_ on a loaned PS4 and the thought of having this type of game on a handheld console that I can also attach to my TV if I want to is more than a little exciting.\n\n{{< youtube hw4W58mTh1A >}}\n",

The core part of the interview concerns the new 16&quot; MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple&rsquo;s butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller&rsquo;s answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, that&rsquo;s not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we&rsquo;ll go down that path.</p>\n<p>iPad benefits because we assume that you need to be able to do most everything with touch, and we don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that experience. Mac assumes you want to do most everything with a keyboard and mouse input. We don&rsquo;t have to trade off on that path.

There are a number of options, but none of them have had particularly good reviews – at least not judging by what I was able to find.

				"content_text": "<p>I just cancelled my Amazon Prime membership.</p><p>As for so many other people, using Amazon's consumer facing services has started to leave a bad taste in my mouth, seeing how atrociously they treat warehouse staff, the negative impact their business has on the delivery drivers of various logistics companies, and the myriad of other small or large bad things this company is doing or is complicit in because it makes them money.</p><p>A few weeks ago I received an email telling me that the credit card Amazon had on file for Prime membership payments was no longer valid and to update the payment settings lest I want to lose my Prime benefits by 12 January 2019.<br>The holidays gave me some time to think about how many of Amazon's services I use daily and consciously and I found that it was too many. Ignoring Amazon services I use by proxy, like AWS servers, here goes:</p><ul><li>Amazon.de and Amazon Marketplace for shopping</li><li>Amazon Prime for fast shipping</li><li>Amazon Prime Video for streaming</li><li>Amazon Kindle for reading ebooks</li><li>Amazon's Audible for audio books.</li></ul><p>With cancelling my Amazon Prime membership, I'm losing access to Prime shipping and Prime Video. Since I've started reducing the amount of things I buy on or through Amazon about a year ago, the former isn't too much of a loss for me. When streaming through Amazon Prime, my partner and I have used her Prime account anyway, so there's no loss for me there, either, until she makes a decision regarding her Amazon Prime account. This could happen sooner rather than later because we use Netflix much more than Prime Video.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how easy it'll be eschewing shopping on Amazon.de entirely and choosing different online shops but I'm not worried about this. The more difficult task will be finding proper replacements for getting ebooks comfortably and finding a good ereader for them. Finding a replacement for Audible will be similarly difficult. And with the latter two there's also the problem of DRM for the things I've already bought on the platforms.</p>\n",

Leider sind viele Strecken auf Komoot eher für Mountainbikes ausgelegt und mit einem ungefederten CX-Rad kommt man da häufig weder gut rauf, noch gesund runter (selbst, wenn ich als Streckentyp &quot;Fahrrad mit Schotter&quot; angebe).</p>\n<p>Ich bastele mir also seit einiger Zeit so meine eigenen Touren und teile hier meine erste, fertige Tour. Sie verbringt viel Zeit auf Schotterpfaden, Waldautobahnen, in den Weinbergen, und unbefestigten Wegen im Wald. Außerdem gibt es am Anfang/Ende einen richtig hübschen Anstieg den Petrisberg hoch. Start- und Endpunkt ist das Restaurant &quot;Jahreszeiten&quot; am Turm Luxemburg, in dem ich immer wieder gerne einkehre.</p>\n<p>Viel Spaß!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.komoot.de/tour/51698725/embed?profile=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"580\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n",
