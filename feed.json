				"content_html": "<p>Late in summer of 2021 I stumbled across a 1996 Trek MultiTrack in almost mint condition on a classifieds site. The seller was running a small business on the side, finding really nice, old bikes in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, cleaning them, repairing what needs repairing and reselling them at a decent mark-up.</p>\n\n<p>The frame is aluminium made for Trek by Easton and welded in the USA.

				"title": "Fun (mostly) gravel ride, even if I didn't complete the 100 miles üö≤",
				"content_html": "<p>I tried myself at an imperial century (100 miles) along the Rhine but had to admit defeat about 100 km into the ride. The weather was brilliant and brilliantly hot and humid. Instead of pushing myself too hard, I decided to veer off to the east and head to the next station to catch a train back home.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DDwNLjc/0/7d55fe59/4K/i-DDwNLjc-4K.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Green wheat fields in the foreground and low rolling hills in the background in harsh sunlight with a lot of haze.\" /></p>\n\n<p>The gravel along the Rhine is perfection; small pebbles and dust. It was easy to find a good cadence and just glide along.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-dqdB2hW/0/02288bc0/4K/i-dqdB2hW-4K.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Light brown gravel road flanked by grass and low shrubs, heading into the distance. To the left the river Rhine. On the far ends left and right, the river and road are flanked by trees.\" /></p>\n\n<p>In places the water meadows along the Rhine reminded me of a bike ride I did in the Everglades, which felt very strange.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-NdwLwNf/0/9ece496f/4K/i-NdwLwNf-4K.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Laden titanium gravel bike covered in dust, leaning against the wood and steel railing of a concrete bridge over one of the interconnected lakes of the Rhine water meadows. The meadow lakes are surrounded by trees.\" /></p>\n\n<p>This was also my first attempt at finding out what works for me in terms of gear and bike setup for longer outdoor rides.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wfKJ9Q2/0/feb60223/4K/i-wfKJ9Q2-4K.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Full close-up of a very dusty titanium gravel bike leaning against the wooden wall of a bus stop.\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Basic drivetrain setup was 46/30 gearing in the front, an 11‚Äì30 cassette in the back.

				"content_text": "I tried myself at an imperial century (100 miles) along the Rhine but had to admit defeat about 100 km into the ride. The weather was brilliant and brilliantly hot and humid. Instead of pushing myself too hard, I decided to veer off to the east and head to the next station to catch a train back home.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DDwNLjc/0/7d55fe59/4K/i-DDwNLjc-4K.jpg \"Green wheat fields in the foreground and low rolling hills in the background in harsh sunlight with a lot of haze.\")\n\nThe gravel along the Rhine is perfection; small pebbles and dust. It was easy to find a good cadence and just glide along.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-dqdB2hW/0/02288bc0/4K/i-dqdB2hW-4K.jpg \"Light brown gravel road flanked by grass and low shrubs, heading into the distance. To the left the river Rhine. On the far ends left and right, the river and road are flanked by trees.\")\n\nIn places the water meadows along the Rhine reminded me of a bike ride I did in the Everglades, which felt very strange.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-NdwLwNf/0/9ece496f/4K/i-NdwLwNf-4K.jpg \"Laden titanium gravel bike covered in dust, leaning against the wood and steel railing of a concrete bridge over one of the interconnected lakes of the Rhine water meadows. The meadow lakes are surrounded by trees.\")\n\nThis was also my first attempt at finding out what works for me in terms of gear and bike setup for longer outdoor rides.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wfKJ9Q2/0/feb60223/4K/i-wfKJ9Q2-4K.jpg \"Full close-up of a very dusty titanium gravel bike leaning against the wooden wall of a bus stop.\")\n\n* Basic drivetrain setup was 46/30 gearing in the front, an 11‚Äì30 cassette in the back.

Originally this seems to be from the platform Quora but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find the original posting.</p>\n\n<p>The question asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why do people get angry when I try to share the word of God with them? I only do it because I care about them deeply and don&rsquo;t want them to end up in hell. I feel like some people avoid me because of this. Is there any way to get through to them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A person calling themselves &ldquo;Doug Robertson&rdquo; responded with this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The entire process is not what you think it is.\nIt is specifically designed to be uncomfortable for the other person because it isn&rsquo;t about converting them to your religion.

				"content_text": "I stumbled across this [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Idle_Threat/status/1315244312922333184). Originally this seems to be from the platform Quora but I wasn't able to find the original posting.\n\nThe question asked:\n\n> Why do people get angry when I try to share the word of God with them? I only do it because I care about them deeply and don't want them to end up in hell. I feel like some people avoid me because of this. Is there any way to get through to them?\n\nA person calling themselves \"Doug Robertson\" responded with this:\n\n> The entire process is not what you think it is. \n> It is specifically designed to be uncomfortable for the other person because it isn't about converting them to your religion. It is about manipulating you so you can't leave yours.  \n> If this tactic was about converting people it would be considered a horrible failure. It recruits almost no one who isn't already willing to join. Bake sales are more effective recruiting tools. On the other hand, it is extremely effective at creating a deep tribal feeling among its own members.\n>  \n> The rejection they receive is actually more important than the few people they convert.

For some reason the gradient data Komoot (and Open Street Maps) has for that part of the forest road, is so terribly off that a section where I expected to ride up a ~ 15% gradient‚Äîsteep but not impossible‚Äîwas actually a rarely used forestry operation road carved up by heavy machinery and rain with a 25%+ gradient.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pHHFfMt/0/d750fda3/X2/i-pHHFfMt-X2.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Strava map of ride on 2020_10_03\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not fun. I pushed or carried my bike uphill for over a kilometre. At the top, which was also the highest point of yesterday&rsquo;s tour, I was exhausted and panting like a furry dog in the midst of summer. Not good.</p>\n\n<p>The following 10¬†km compensated me for that slog with beautiful view and incredible riding over everything from flowy double track, challenging single track, even more challenging‚Äîfor a gravel bike‚Äîuphill single track over rocks and roots and finally a long and fast descent towards the Schlossberg on fire roads.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nc3kV2r/0/80978ea4/X5/i-Nc3kV2r-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"View from the Kandelh√∂henweg over Freiburg-Z√§hringen and Freiburg-Herdern.\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was my first time at the viewpoint next to the tram on the Schlossberg and I enjoyed seeing the city I now live in from yet another perspective.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-zQdHnbk/0/d2ecf86a/X5/i-zQdHnbk-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"View over downtown Freiburg from the tram on the Schlossberg.\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-9bLBwsD/0/0f81520d/X5/i-9bLBwsD-X5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Titanium gravel bike leaning against a fence overlooking downtown Freiburg and the Freiburger M√ºnster.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Standing there, eating the rest of my energy bar, I had to concede that the climbs at the start of the tour combined with the gruelling ascent pushing the bike robbed me of so much energy, that finishing the ride on the planned route (back through the forest) wasn&rsquo;t possible and so I rode home on the road ‚Ä¶ a bit annoyed because chunky gravel tyres make riding on tarmac feel like wading through molasses but I was still happy overall.</p>\n",

Two of them were quite insistent to get face scritches and I obliged.  \nWhat I didn't expect, though, was that I had to go over their pasture to continue on my planned route and I expected even less that they'd attempt to join me.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nn8FCNZ/0/f4b93f61/X5/i-Nn8FCNZ-X5.jpg \"A herd of young cows walking towards the photographer on a pasture on the side of a hill in bright sunlight.\")\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wws2m8J/0/0b5a2ec4/X5/i-wws2m8J-X5.jpg \"Herd of cows following the cyclist in one line on a pasture service road.\")\n\nAfter that things went downhill quickly by going uphill too steeply.  \nTurns Out‚Ñ¢ I had planned this next part of the route badly.  For some reason the gradient data Komoot (and Open Street Maps) has for that part of the forest road, is so terribly off that a section where I expected to ride up a ~ 15% gradient‚Äîsteep but not impossible‚Äîwas actually a rarely used forestry operation road carved up by heavy machinery and rain with a 25%+ gradient.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pHHFfMt/0/d750fda3/X2/i-pHHFfMt-X2.jpg \"Strava map of ride on 2020_10_03\")\n\nNot fun. I pushed or carried my bike uphill for over a kilometre. At the top, which was also the highest point of yesterday's tour, I was exhausted and panting like a furry dog in the midst of summer. Not good.\n\nThe following 10¬†km compensated me for that slog with beautiful view and incredible riding over everything from flowy double track, challenging single track, even more challenging‚Äîfor a gravel bike‚Äîuphill single track over rocks and roots and finally a long and fast descent towards the Schlossberg on fire roads.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nc3kV2r/0/80978ea4/X5/i-Nc3kV2r-X5.jpg \"View from the Kandelh√∂henweg over Freiburg-Z√§hringen and Freiburg-Herdern.\")\n\nIt was my first time at the viewpoint next to the tram on the Schlossberg and I enjoyed seeing the city I now live in from yet another perspective.\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-zQdHnbk/0/d2ecf86a/X5/i-zQdHnbk-X5.jpg \"View over downtown Freiburg from the tram on the Schlossberg.\")\n\n![](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-9bLBwsD/0/0f81520d/X5/i-9bLBwsD-X5.jpg \"Titanium gravel bike leaning against a fence overlooking downtown Freiburg and the Freiburger M√ºnster.\")\n\nStanding there, eating the rest of my energy bar, I had to concede that the climbs at the start of the tour combined with the gruelling ascent pushing the bike robbed me of so much energy, that finishing the ride on the planned route (back through the forest) wasn't possible and so I rode home on the road ‚Ä¶ a bit annoyed because chunky gravel tyres make riding on tarmac feel like wading through molasses but I was still happy overall.\n",

				"title": "Nice little 2√ó drivetrain gear ratio quirk",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p><code>Warning, this may be a bit wordy and nerdy.</code></p>\n\n<p>I have been researching drivetrain options again‚Äîdon‚Äòt judge me‚Äîbecause I found myself wanting a bit more evenly and tightly spaced gears on both my road bike and my gravel bike.<br />\nThe area I moved to a while back (southern Black Forest, Germany) is an absolute dream for cyclists: I can climb to my heart‚Äòs content either on- or off- road and when I just want to go fast on the flat, a short trip into the <em>wiiide</em> Rhine valley and it‚Äòs <strong>go-time</strong> ‚Äì yes, I went there.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"current-setup\">Current setup</h2>\n\n<p>On Panthor, my road bike, I presently have a 1√ó (single chainring) setup using a 36-tooth chainring and a 12-speed 9‚Äì46 e*thirteen TRS+ 2nd gen cassette. For the 11 gear shifts, I get an average gear ratio change of 13.8%. The gear ratio in the lowest gear is 0.78 and in the highest gear it‚Äòs 4.0.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>On Battle Cat, my gravel bike, it‚Äôs a 1√ó setup with a 32-tooth chainring on the front and a 11-speed 9‚Äì39 e*thirteen XCX cassette on the back. That gives me a solid 0.82 gear ratio on the bottom end of the spectrum and 3.55 on the top end, as well as 10 gear changes with an average gear ratio change of 13.6%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changing-things-up\">Changing things up</h2>\n\n<p>Digging into some good combinations of cassette and chain rings, I had two sets of requirements\n1. A closer grouping of the gears on the road bike is desirable but with at least one climbing gear with a gear ratio below 1.\n2. A low climbing gear on the gravel bike is a must given the steep and quite technical terrain I‚Äòm riding more and more often but I also want fairly evenly spaced gears throughout the range, to tackle longer rides across varied terrain more comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>There‚Äòs an incredible amount of choice in the market for realising what I wanted on both bikes but in all cases I found out that a 2√ó (double chainring) setup was probably the only way to get there.</p>\n\n<p>Most cyclists know or have heard that a 2√ó11 setup typically offers 14 unique gears. This can vary depending on the choice of  chainrings and cassette in the back. I‚Äòve compared a lot of cassettes and chainring combinations using a nifty little online gear calculation tool by <a href=\"https://www.j-berkemeier.de/Ritzelrechner.html\">J√ºrgen Berkemeier</a>; everything from the e*thirteen and Shimano cassettes I have at home to options from SRAM, Sunrace, Garbaruk, KCNC, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I looked at various double chainring options, ranging from insane 53/38 to the 46/36 I still have on my Rotor 3D30 crankset to 46/30.

				"content_text": "`Warning, this may be a bit wordy and nerdy.`\n\nI have been researching drivetrain options again‚Äîdon‚Äòt judge me‚Äîbecause I found myself wanting a bit more evenly and tightly spaced gears on both my road bike and my gravel bike.  \nThe area I moved to a while back (southern Black Forest, Germany) is an absolute dream for cyclists: I can climb to my heart‚Äòs content either on- or off- road and when I just want to go fast on the flat, a short trip into the _wiiide_ Rhine valley and it‚Äòs **go-time** ‚Äì yes, I went there.\n\n## Current setup\n\nOn Panthor, my road bike, I presently have a 1√ó (single chainring) setup using a 36-tooth chainring and a 12-speed 9‚Äì46 e*thirteen TRS+ 2nd gen cassette. For the 11 gear shifts, I get an average gear ratio change of 13.8%. The gear ratio in the lowest gear is 0.78 and in the highest gear it‚Äòs 4.0.[^1]\n\nOn Battle Cat, my gravel bike, it‚Äôs a 1√ó setup with a 32-tooth chainring on the front and a 11-speed 9‚Äì39 e*thirteen XCX cassette on the back. That gives me a solid 0.82 gear ratio on the bottom end of the spectrum and 3.55 on the top end, as well as 10 gear changes with an average gear ratio change of 13.6%.\n\n## Changing things up\n\nDigging into some good combinations of cassette and chain rings, I had two sets of requirements\n1. A closer grouping of the gears on the road bike is desirable but with at least one climbing gear with a gear ratio below 1.\n2. A low climbing gear on the gravel bike is a must given the steep and quite technical terrain I‚Äòm riding more and more often but I also want fairly evenly spaced gears throughout the range, to tackle longer rides across varied terrain more comfortably.\n\nThere‚Äòs an incredible amount of choice in the market for realising what I wanted on both bikes but in all cases I found out that a 2√ó (double chainring) setup was probably the only way to get there.\n\nMost cyclists know or have heard that a 2√ó11 setup typically offers 14 unique gears. This can vary depending on the choice of  chainrings and cassette in the back. I‚Äòve compared a lot of cassettes and chainring combinations using a nifty little online gear calculation tool by [J√ºrgen Berkemeier](https://www.j-berkemeier.de/Ritzelrechner.html); everything from the e*thirteen and Shimano cassettes I have at home to options from SRAM, Sunrace, Garbaruk, KCNC, etc.\n\nSimilarly, I looked at various double chainring options, ranging from insane 53/38 to the 46/36 I still have on my Rotor 3D30 crankset to 46/30. Most of those combinations when paired with almost any cassette end up giving me 14 unique gears, a few give me 15 and even fewer only 13.\nInterestingly, depending on the difference in teeth between the big and small chainrings, I‚Äòve seen cassette + double-chainrings combinations where the shift from big to small or small to big chainring (and compensating in the rear) results in a 2%‚Äì4% gear ratio increase. I‚Äòd consider this barely usable, which means that these combinations really only offer 14 instead of 15 or 13 instead of 14 unique and usable gears.\n\n## Now here‚Äòs the funny bit.\n\n46/30 chainrings are the only ones I found that, paired with the right cassette in the back, end up with 15 proper, unique gears and a change from the small to the big front ring (again while compensating 3 gears on the cassette), results in an actually usable jump of 7%‚Äì9%.  \nI checked other variations of 16-tooth difference chainrings but none seemed to work out with such a high gear ratio increase.[^2]\n\nIt gets even funnier looking at the cassettes. Only two cassettes I‚Äòve found, have cog size spacing that results in 15 proper gears:\n* Shimano CS-R8000 11‚Äì32\n* Shimano CS-M8000 11‚Äì40\n\n## What now?\n\nI‚Äòm going back to 2√ó on both my bikes. ‚Äì ***GASP!***\n\nPanthor is going to receive a 46/30 chainring coupled with the 11‚Äì32 cassette. This gets me a gear ratio of 0.9375 in the lowest and 4.18 in the highest gear and and average gear ratio change of 10.11%, a reduction of ~ 3.6%. This average value may not sound like too much but looking at the gear ratio changes across the current 11 and soon 14 shifts, it‚Äòs substantially closer gearing that‚Äòll give me a much more consistent cadence.\n\nBattle Cat will also get a 46/30 chainring connected to a 12‚Äì40 cassette.[^3] The low gear will offer a ratio of 0.75‚Äî*WOOOOO! Insane climbs here I come!*‚Äîand the high gear is going to have a value of 3.83, which is plenty. The average gear ratio value will be ~ 11% (down from 13.6%) across 14 gear changes (up from 10).\n\nI‚Äôm not sure how long this is going to stick, if I like the setups for riding, and to a lesser degree from a visual perspective ‚Äì vanity in cycling is a thing, y‚Äòknow.  \nThankfully I still have a set of Ultegra R8000 brake shifters and an Ultegra R800 front derailleur at home.

				"content_html": "<p>My colleague and friend Mike sent me a link to an <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/\">interview with Phil Schiller on c|net conducted by Roger Cheng</a>. The core part of the interview concerns the new 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple&rsquo;s butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller&rsquo;s answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, that&rsquo;s not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path.

The core part of the interview concerns the new 16\" MacBook Pro and the redesign of the keyboard away from Apple's butterfly mechanism to an improved scissor mechanism. Later in the discussion, they talk about how iPads and Macs coexist and the purpose of each device. Schiller's answer to a question about whether Apple can see the iPad and Mac merging like this:\n\n> No, that's not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path.

There are a number of options, but none of them have had particularly good reviews ‚Äì at least not judging by what I was able to find.  Most annoyingly, very few reviews even consider the accuracy of the integrated gauge, stating that it&rsquo;s good enough for (off-)road side repairs.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/mini-pumps/1142-roadie-da-g\">Topeak ROADIE DA G</a> is a fairly recent release and being happy with a few other of their products, I decided to give it a go.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"basics\">Basics</h3>\n\n<p>The pump pushes air into the tyre when pushing and pulling on the barrel, which, theortically should help fill the tyre more quickly.

It&rsquo;s compact, doesn&rsquo;t stick out of a jersey pocket too far and even fits into some saddle bags. The included bottlge cage mount is solid and has held up across a number of hard gravel rides already.</p>\n\n<p>I was very happy to find that the pressure gauge is quite accurate. Comparing it with a dedicated digital gauge and the gauge in my floor pump, it yielded almost identical results when I aimed to hit ùë•.0 Bar or ùë•.ùë• Bar on the gauge. This allowes me to much more accurately and quickly get my tyres up to the desired pressure than doing the &ldquo;pump, pump, pump, detach pump, attach gauge, check pressure, detach gauge, pump some more, check again&rdquo; spiel.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I consider a downside is the pump&rsquo;s barrel getting very hot when reaching pressures of 3.2 Bar and up. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s fine when you&rsquo;re wearing gloves but more than a couple of times when nearing 4 Bar, I had to stop pumping to let the barrel cool down a bit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"suitability-for-700-40c-tyres\">Suitability for 700√ó40c tyres</h3>\n\n<p>The bigger issue from my perspective is the suitability for tyres typically used on gravel bikes.

Right now, most manufacturers of pumps distinguish between high-volume pumps for mountain bike tyres, and high-pressure pumps for road bikes.

Tuna Tango sushi burrito  @suandbu 106 John Street, 6. hot dog slider and pizza at Sightlines Restaurant at the Rogers Centre (the food there wasn‚Äôt particularly good but it was my first baseball game experience and that counts for something).\n\n<img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/6f95d94b9c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/8198bf12fc.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/a13b3d41c9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" /><img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2a48d51f2e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/43ead5ecb9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" /><img src=\"https://mangochutney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/d86fea950b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I've watched Batman v Superman a couples of times now. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It has some very serious problems with representing women that were hard to look past most of the time and made me cringe. Walking out of the cinema on premiere weekend‚Äîfittingly, the Metropolis in Frankfurt‚Äîdiscussing the movie with my sister, I felt that apart from aforementioned issue, something was off with the movie, that it felt like a bunch of snapshots of events put together, making it hard to find any sort of golden thread.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I stumbled across this interesting video review with an overly sensationalistic title, capturing this particular issue pretty well:</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/38Cy_Qlh7VM\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, it was an entertaining film and the extended edition is a bit better, in my opinion. The shortest and most accurate criticism came from the inimitable <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darth/\">@darth</a> on Twitter tonight:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Wonder Woman was severely underrepresented in the movie but what saved it for me was the feeling that in the few moments Wonder Woman was on screen, the writers, the director, and most importantly Gal Gadot managed to capture the core of the character. She's educated, smart, more experienced and more level-headed than Batman or Superman, strong, a formidable fighter, and a true warrior.</p>\n<p>There was a scene in the fight against Doomsday, where she was thrown back by a mighty blow of the creature but catching herself, the look on her face showed determination and the joy of battle.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of one of my favourite moments in DC's New 52 run when Superman and Wonder Woman became a couple. Batman was explaining his misgivings about their relationship to Superman by showing Supes a number of boxes stored in a secure corner of the Bat Cave. Each of these boxes contained countermeasures for each member of the Justice League, should they ever go rogue. The only one he didn't have a countermeasure for, was Wonder Woman. He deemed her so powerful that the only way to stop her, if turned evil, would be Superman.</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope that the 2017 Wonder Woman and the Justice League movies capture all facets of the character; the grace, the wisdom, the unshakeable belief in doing the right thing, the knowledge that sacrifices are sometimes necessary in battle, and not just the looks and fighting skills. The ComicCon trailer does look promising:</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5lGoQhFb4NM\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Bonus: \"Everything Wrong With <strong>Batman v Superman</strong>\"</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/X5tSpgU96WY\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n",

There are only two things to observe when attaching it to the GR0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The middle vertical strap on the Harney Pouch can't be used (it's not really a MOLLE solution), and</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/33064d4afb.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/7a898d4f28.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching the f-stop Harney Pouch in the Goruck GR0 2\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the best possible fit, the vertical strap should be pulled through the topmost horizontal row of webbing on the Harney Pouch first and then through the topmost horizontal row of the GR0's internal webbing.

I'm a photography beginner and don't have much gear ‚Äî I also don't plan to build up a massive arsenal of lenses and cameras. Here's what's inside the Harney Pouch:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/efb1c11430.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 1\"></p>\n<p>To the left there's the Fujifilm Fujinon XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS with the lens hood. The X-E1 rests in the middle, with the XF 23mm F1.4 R including the lens hood and an OP/TECH 'SLR Wrist Strap' attached. On the right there's the shoulder pad of my OP/TECH 'Utility Strap ‚Äì Sling' (<a href=\"http://www.mangochutney.me/optech-camera-gear/\">which I reviewed here</a>), the charger for the X-E1's batteries and the charger cable.<br>\nIn the frontmost compartment I store spare batteries and the memory cards and the middle compartment houses parts of the OP/TECH strap and some accessories for it as well as a spare lens cleaning cloth.</p>\n<p>When I'm certain that I won't be using the camera during transit, I also store a rocket blower in the Harney Pouch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/5a07bdf800.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch, contents 2\"></p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, there's enough room in this camera bag to accomodate a mid-sized SLR with one additional lens or an even smaller mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (like the Sony Alpha 5000) with two additional lenses and some accessories.</p>\n<p>When attached to the GR0, it effectively eats about 1/3 of the usuable volume (5 of 21 available litres). It also makes the ruck rather top-heavy, causing it to collapse into itself when not fully packed. However, this isn't necessarily much of an issue: when trying to retreive something from the Harney Pouch while out and about, I usually stand the GR0 up straight, leaning it against one of my legs, or hoist it over one shoulder in front of my chest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/473edab354.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch in the empty Goruck GR0\"></p>\n<p>This is what the GR0 looks like when I'm going somewhere without my laptop:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.mangochutney.me/uploads/2021/000773eaae.jpg\" alt=\"f-stop Harney Pouch in the filled Goruck GR0\"></p>\n<p>For reference: Light waterproof jacket, 0.5 l stainless steel bottle, Tasmanian Tiger TacPouch (used as an organiser for smaller items), specs case for my sunglasses, and a specs case that I use for my earphones.</p>\n<p>If I take the laptop with me, it's stored in the appropriate compartment in the back while its accessories and backup hard drive are organised in a <a href=\"http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=61&product_id=154\">medium-sized Cocoon Grid-It! organiser</a> and stored in the main compartment. With all of the above already in the Goruck GR0, there's still enough space for some food and a light fleece sweater.</p>\n<p>In larger Goruck backpacks the volume of the Harney Pouch will have a comparatively smaller impact on the available space of the backpack. And if I really need the internal space of the GR0, I can also attach the Harney Pouch to the outside of the GR0.</p>\n<p>In conclusion I can say that it's hard to imagine a more fitting solution to carry my camera gear within the Goruck GR0 than the f-stop Harney Pouch. Inside the backpack it gives me quick access to my camera gear while staying out of the way when I pack my stuff. Outside the GR0 it is a sturdy, well-made, versatile, spacious (enough), and comfortable camera bag. Considering what it does, $¬†75.- (I paid ‚Ç¨¬†55.-) isn't too much to ask.</p>\n",

And if I really need the internal space of the GR0, I can also attach the Harney Pouch to the outside of the GR0.</p>\n<p>In conclusion I can say that it's hard to imagine a more fitting solution to carry my camera gear within the Goruck GR0 than the f-stop Harney Pouch. Inside the backpack it gives me quick access to my camera gear while staying out of the way when I pack my stuff. Outside the GR0 it is a sturdy, well-made, versatile, spacious (enough), and comfortable camera bag. Considering what it does, $¬†75.- (I paid ‚Ç¨¬†55.-) isn't too much to ask.</p>\n",

A few quick checks at the major online retailers revealed that its products were generally well-liked, sturdy, and reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity I purchased the <em><a href=\"http://optechusa.com/utility-strap-sling.html\">Utility Strap - Sling</a></em>, and the <em><a href=\"http://optechusa.com/slr-wrist-strap.html\">SLR Wrist Strap</a></em> from OP/TECH.

These, however, seem to be exceptionally sturdy and well-made, locking in place with a satisfying <strong>CLICK</strong> and no wiggle room.</p>\n<p>It turns out that my anxiety was unwarranted.

				"title": "My first impressions of the Nexus 7 and Android",
				"content_html": "<p>For the past six years my primary computing devices have been iPhones, iPads and Apple computers. Five days ago I was given an ASUS Nexus 7 by my employer for testing purposes. Here are some of my first impressions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"thedevice\">The Device</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The form factor of the Nexus 7 feels strange. Having used iPhones and iPads for years a 16:9 screen feels alien for browsing the web and reading books and other written content.</li>\n<li>The build quality is good. To be honest I was surprised by this. It's not comparable to current Apple tablets or even the Microsoft Surface 2, but on the other hand the Nexus 7 costs a lot less. With the exception of the SIM card slot I'd equate the build quality and the perceived density of the device to an iPhone 3G.</li>\n<li>I'm not a fan of soft-touch coatings on devices and the Nexus 7 is no exception. They feel interesting for a while, but when they wear off the devices look crappy. Admittedly the coating on this tablet is among the best I've seen so far and I'll reserve my judgement for when it has been used a few months.</li>\n<li>The cameras, both front and back, are decent but nothing to write home about ‚Äî which is perfectly fine for me as they only need to deliver good video quality for video calls and the occasional snapshot.</li>\n<li>The display itself is stunning; colours are great, viewing angles, too. Watching videos on it feels more natural than reading articles on the internet.</li>\n<li>The speakers are lousy, but at least the headphone port is decent.</li>\n<li>The buttons on the side are nice and firm and react precisely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"theoperatingsystem\">The Operating System</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>One thing I noticed immediately was that the interface is a bit laggy. This tablet is one of the fastest Android devices out there, yet iOS 7 on my iPad 2 from 2011 feels more responsive.</li>\n<li>The system (Android 4.4.2) is a bit overwhelming to be honest. The amount of customisablity‚Äîsome, it seems, just for the sake of it‚Äîoften has me second-guessing myself. I won't deny that Android is powerful, but it demands a lot from the user. The learning curve is very steep and I think that the average user won't ever scratch the surface of what it can do.</li>\n<li>The way Android approaches home screens and applications reminds me very much of Windows. Instead of a number of apps I have five small desktops that I can customise to a certain degree, but all my apps still reside in the applications menu (like the start menu). Another system I feel reminded of is my old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5\">Psion 5mx</a> running <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)\">EPOC32</a>, the precursor to Symbian.</li>\n<li>I'm not thrilled by the widgets. I already installed a good number of apps but with the exception of a few, widgets are rarely more useful than an icon with a badge. I have a good weather widget installed and the GMail widget, but most widgets seem to have been designed as an afterthought. Google's widgets show that there's potential, but I've seen nothing really compelling so far.</li>\n<li>The way notifications are handled is great. Same goes for quick access to core features of the device. Apple has nailed the latter with Control Center in iOS 7, but it's very clear that Android was the inspiration. Notifications are something that Apple definitely needs to work on, because right now it's neither here nor there.</li>\n<li>Having access to the filesystem has certain upsides but also a lot of downsides. Personally I like not having to deal with a filesystem in iOS, <em>but</em> it's great that on Android more than one app can access the same file without requiring me to move it between apps. Allowing an app to see, open and modify all files it's capable of opening on the entire device, is something I will need before I can truly start replacing my laptop with an iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"thesoftware\">The Software</h4>\n<p>There are very few applications I miss. The ones I do miss are pretty specialised apps that not many other people will find useful, but the most important ones all have fairly decent equivalents or acutal counterparts. The biggest drawback I see in most apps is that they don't integrate (well) with the third-party services I use (like Pinboard) but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RSS:</strong> On iOS I use <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder 2</a> syncing with <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. On Android I found <a href=\"http://twentyfivesquares.com/press/\">Press</a>. It's only a few bucks and possibly the best RSS reader on Android right now. It reminds me heavily of the old Reeder on the iPad and I really enjoy using it.</li>\n<li><strong>App.net:</strong> <a href=\"http://riposteapp.net\">Riposte</a> + <a href=\"http://\">Whisper</a> is what I use on iOS for ADN and ADN private messages, on Android <a href=\"https://www.robinapp.net\">Robin</a> is my app of choice at the moment. It looks great, makes even greater use of the tablet's screen (especially in landscape mode) and is very responsive. The only oddity is that I can't seem to filter out conversations as well as in Riposte.</li>\n<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Nothing beats <a href=\"http://twitterrific.com/ios\">Twitterrific</a> on iOS for me, on Android <a href=\"http://getfalcon.pro\">Falcon Pro</a> seems the way to go, even if setting it up is more than convoluted thanks to Twitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Movies:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.eplayworks.com/section/product/avPlayer.php?lang=en\">AVPlayer HD</a> might have a slightly odd interface, but has very meaningful gesture controls and deals well with different file formats. On Android the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html\">VLC beta</a> is the way to go for now.</li>\n<li><strong>Skype:</strong> I use the service very often and the Android app is not only a lot nicer than the iOS app, it's easier to use and more responsive. It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>\n<li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> Similar to Skype, the Dropbox app seems a lot more useful on Android than on iOS and the UI is much nicer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, these are my first impressions of the device and the software. In a few weeks I'll write some more, once I've really gotten to know both.</p>\n",

Another system I feel reminded of is my old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5\">Psion 5mx</a> running <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)\">EPOC32</a>, the precursor to Symbian.</li>\n<li>I'm not thrilled by the widgets. I already installed a good number of apps but with the exception of a few, widgets are rarely more useful than an icon with a badge. I have a good weather widget installed and the GMail widget, but most widgets seem to have been designed as an afterthought. Google's widgets show that there's potential, but I've seen nothing really compelling so far.</li>\n<li>The way notifications are handled is great. Same goes for quick access to core features of the device. Apple has nailed the latter with Control Center in iOS 7, but it's very clear that Android was the inspiration. Notifications are something that Apple definitely needs to work on, because right now it's neither here nor there.</li>\n<li>Having access to the filesystem has certain upsides but also a lot of downsides. Personally I like not having to deal with a filesystem in iOS, <em>but</em> it's great that on Android more than one app can access the same file without requiring me to move it between apps. Allowing an app to see, open and modify all files it's capable of opening on the entire device, is something I will need before I can truly start replacing my laptop with an iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"thesoftware\">The Software</h4>\n<p>There are very few applications I miss. The ones I do miss are pretty specialised apps that not many other people will find useful, but the most important ones all have fairly decent equivalents or acutal counterparts. The biggest drawback I see in most apps is that they don't integrate (well) with the third-party services I use (like Pinboard) but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RSS:</strong> On iOS I use <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder 2</a> syncing with <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. On Android I found <a href=\"http://twentyfivesquares.com/press/\">Press</a>. It's only a few bucks and possibly the best RSS reader on Android right now. It reminds me heavily of the old Reeder on the iPad and I really enjoy using it.</li>\n<li><strong>App.net:</strong> <a href=\"http://riposteapp.net\">Riposte</a> + <a href=\"http://\">Whisper</a> is what I use on iOS for ADN and ADN private messages, on Android <a href=\"https://www.robinapp.net\">Robin</a> is my app of choice at the moment. It looks great, makes even greater use of the tablet's screen (especially in landscape mode) and is very responsive. The only oddity is that I can't seem to filter out conversations as well as in Riposte.</li>\n<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Nothing beats <a href=\"http://twitterrific.com/ios\">Twitterrific</a> on iOS for me, on Android <a href=\"http://getfalcon.pro\">Falcon Pro</a> seems the way to go, even if setting it up is more than convoluted thanks to Twitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Movies:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.eplayworks.com/section/product/avPlayer.php?lang=en\">AVPlayer HD</a> might have a slightly odd interface, but has very meaningful gesture controls and deals well with different file formats. On Android the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html\">VLC beta</a> is the way to go for now.</li>\n<li><strong>Skype:</strong> I use the service very often and the Android app is not only a lot nicer than the iOS app, it's easier to use and more responsive. It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>\n<li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> Similar to Skype, the Dropbox app seems a lot more useful on Android than on iOS and the UI is much nicer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, these are my first impressions of the device and the software. In a few weeks I'll write some more, once I've really gotten to know both.</p>\n",

Of course I only noticed that once I sat in my home office again, while importing gigabytes of pictures into <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/aperture/\">Aperture</a>.<br>\nThis is where it started to go downhill, because while Aperture seems to do a fine job of processing the RAW file format Fujifilm uses, it doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to change the EXIF data of the files.</p>\n<p>After a lot of searching, the only viable solution turned out to be a command line application called <a href=\"http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\">exiftool</a> by Phil Harvey.<br>\nIt allows for <a href=\"http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/Shift.pdf\">date and time shifting</a> using an easy syntax ‚Äî &ldquo;easy&rdquo; once you&rsquo;ve stopped feeling intimidated by the prospect of using a command line application for a task like this.</p>\n<p><em>The following workaround has been done on a Mac, but since exiftool works on Windows, Linux and OS X this can be applied to other setups as well. On Windows there&rsquo;s actually a nice GUI application called <a href=\"http://www.geosetter.de\">Geosetter</a> that uses exiftool in the background, making the entire process even less intimidating.</em></p>\n<p>I initially thought I had to export everything from Aperture into a folder and then let loose exiftool on the exported files like a hungry hyena, but it was much easier than that. Seeing that each Aperture library file is a glorified folder, you can right click it in the Finder and select &lsquo;Show Package Contents&rsquo; from the context menu. A folder will open, showing the contents of the library.<br>\nInside that folder the master files are kept in the folder &lsquo;masters&rsquo; (Duh!), sorted into subfolders for years, months and (approximate) days and times.</p>\n<p>Now to the actual use of exiftool for my problem:<br>\nI wanted to change all date tags inside each photo (EXIF data contains more than one date tag and I wasn&rsquo;t sure which one Aperture would use or if it would get confused if it found two different dates in one file). As I had set the X-E1 to capture both a RAF file and a JPG at the same time, I needed it to change the JPG date and time stamps as well.</p>\n<p>After closing Aperture the first problem I faced when running exiftool on a few files was that it returned minor errors and warnings like this;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warning: Non-null bytes found in padding ‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and subsequently didn&rsquo;t process files that returned errors.  I thought that there had to be some way to still process these files and a quick search for the warning turned up a forum thread and the maker of exiftool provided an <a href=\"http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,3961.msg18594.html#msg18594\">answer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;As far as I can tell, the non-null bytes in the normally-empty section of the RAF image aren&rsquo;t referenced from anywhere, so I&rsquo;m thinking that they are just garbage data.¬† I&rsquo;ll update the next version of ExifTool to make this a minor error, allowing the file to be written with the -m option.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The &lsquo;<em>-m</em>&rsquo; option you say? A quick look into the documentation revealed this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-m (-ignoreMinorErrors) Ignore minor errors and warnings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that in mind, here&rsquo;s what I did:<br>\nI opened a Terminal window and entere the command</p>\n<p><code>exiftool -AllDates+=&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo; -m /Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</code></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the command does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>exiftool</strong> launches the application.</li>\n<li><strong>-AllDates</strong> changes all dates tag within a picture.</li>\n<li><strong>+=</strong> tells the app that the adjustment will advance the dates into the future (&lsquo;-=&rsquo; would put them into the past).</li>\n<li><strong>&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo;</strong> changes the date by &lsquo;2years:0months:0days 6hours:0minutes:0seconds&rsquo;.</li>\n<li><strong>/Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</strong> represents the location of my photos or a single file in the Aperture library package/folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cool thing about the way the Terminal works in OS X, is that you don&rsquo;t even have to type in the folder path manually ‚Äî a source of many frustrating errors.  Instead you can drag the icon next to the title of the folder from the Finder window into the Terminal window and place it behind the command (don&rsquo;t forget the space between &lsquo;-m&rsquo; and the folder path).</p>\n<p>What resulted in the folder were .RAF and .JPG files with changed EXIF data and .RAF_original/.JPG_original files, the latter being the original files exiftool kept as a backup. I removed these files from the folder and put them in a backup location on my hard drive until I was sure that the new files not only had the right date, but were also intact.</p>\n<p>I started Aperture again, and after a few seconds it realised that the dates had changed and started to rearrange the files. Having changed quite a lot of files, it took a couple of minutes to re-process the photos, but afterwards everything looked great and all photos had the correct date and time associated with them.</p>\n<p>In summary this shouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary. Aperture‚Äîbeing the advanced application that it supposedly is‚Äîshould be able to change date and times stamps as well as every other piece of EXIT and IPTC data I want it to change, because mistakes happen. Thankfully exiftool and similar applications exist, allowing users to make these changes and I&rsquo;ll be sending Phil Harvey some money because his work saved me a lot of headaches.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a condensed version of the workflow I used to change the date and time stamps in the EXIF data of my photos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Close Aperture.</li>\n<li>Open the Aperture library package/folder by right-clicking it in the finder and selecting &lsquo;Show Package Contents&rsquo;.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the &lsquo;masters&rsquo; folder and the subfolder holding the pictures that need EXIF data adjustments.</li>\n<li>Open a Terminal window and type the following command <code>exiftool -AllDates+=&lsquo;2:0:0 6:0:0&rsquo; -m</code>. Add a space behind the &lsquo;-m&rsquo;.</li>\n<li>Drag the folder icon left of the title of the folder in the Finder window and drop it behind the command.</li>\n<li>Hit return on the keyboard and wait for exiftool to finish processing the files.</li>\n<li>Move the .JPG_original/.RAF_original/.XYZ_original files to a backup location outside the Aperture library package/folder until the successful adjustment has been confirmed.</li>\n<li>Launch Aperture, select the project in question and give Aperture some time to re-process the photos.</li>\n<li>If the desired changes have been applied correctly and Aperture doesn&rsquo;t show any errors or wrong EXIF information, delete the backup files.</li>\n</ol></p>\n",

Seeing that each Aperture library file is a glorified folder, you can right click it in the Finder and select 'Show Package Contents' from the context menu. A folder will open, showing the contents of the library.<br>\nInside that folder the master files are kept in the folder 'masters' (Duh!), sorted into subfolders for years, months and (approximate) days and times.</p>\n<p>Now to the actual use of exiftool for my problem:<br>\nI wanted to change all date tags inside each photo (EXIF data contains more than one date tag and I wasn't sure which one Aperture would use or if it would get confused if it found two different dates in one file). As I had set the X-E1 to capture both a RAF file and a JPG at the same time, I needed it to change the JPG date and time stamps as well.</p>\n<p>After closing Aperture the first problem I faced when running exiftool on a few files was that it returned minor errors and warnings like this;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warning: Non-null bytes found in padding ‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and subsequently didn't process files that returned errors.  I thought that there had to be some way to still process these files and a quick search for the warning turned up a forum thread and the maker of exiftool provided an <a href=\"http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,3961.msg18594.html#msg18594\">answer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As far as I can tell, the non-null bytes in the normally-empty section of the RAF image aren't referenced from anywhere, so I'm thinking that they are just garbage data.¬† I'll update the next version of ExifTool to make this a minor error, allowing the file to be written with the -m option.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The '<em>-m</em>' option you say? A quick look into the documentation revealed this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-m (-ignoreMinorErrors) Ignore minor errors and warnings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that in mind, here's what I did:<br>\nI opened a Terminal window and entere the command</p>\n<p><code>exiftool -AllDates+='2:0:0 6:0:0' -m /Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</code></p>\n<p>Here's what the command does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>exiftool</strong> launches the application.</li>\n<li><strong>-AllDates</strong> changes all dates tag within a picture.</li>\n<li><strong>+=</strong> tells the app that the adjustment will advance the dates into the future ('-=' would put them into the past).</li>\n<li><strong>'2:0:0 6:0:0'</strong> changes the date by '2years:0months:0days 6hours:0minutes:0seconds'.</li>\n<li><strong>/Volumes/folder-path-to-my-photos</strong> represents the location of my photos or a single file in the Aperture library package/folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cool thing about the way the Terminal works in OS X, is that you don't even have to type in the folder path manually ‚Äî a source of many frustrating errors.  Instead you can drag the icon next to the title of the folder from the Finder window into the Terminal window and place it behind the command (don't forget the space between '-m' and the folder path).</p>\n<p>What resulted in the folder were .RAF and .JPG files with changed EXIF data and .RAF_original/.JPG_original files, the latter being the original files exiftool kept as a backup. I removed these files from the folder and put them in a backup location on my hard drive until I was sure that the new files not only had the right date, but were also intact.</p>\n<p>I started Aperture again, and after a few seconds it realised that the dates had changed and started to rearrange the files. Having changed quite a lot of files, it took a couple of minutes to re-process the photos, but afterwards everything looked great and all photos had the correct date and time associated with them.</p>\n<p>In summary this shouldn't have been necessary. Aperture‚Äîbeing the advanced application that it supposedly is‚Äîshould be able to change date and times stamps as well as every other piece of EXIT and IPTC data I want it to change, because mistakes happen. Thankfully exiftool and similar applications exist, allowing users to make these changes and I'll be sending Phil Harvey some money because his work saved me a lot of headaches.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here's a condensed version of the workflow I used to change the date and time stamps in the EXIF data of my photos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Close Aperture.</li>\n<li>Open the Aperture library package/folder by right-clicking it in the finder and selecting 'Show Package Contents'.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the 'masters' folder and the subfolder holding the pictures that need EXIF data adjustments.</li>\n<li>Open a Terminal window and type the following command <code>exiftool -AllDates+='2:0:0 6:0:0' -m</code>. Add a space behind the '-m'.</li>\n<li>Drag the folder icon left of the title of the folder in the Finder window and drop it behind the command.</li>\n<li>Hit return on the keyboard and wait for exiftool to finish processing the files.</li>\n<li>Move the .JPG_original/.RAF_original/.XYZ_original files to a backup location outside the Aperture library package/folder until the successful adjustment has been confirmed.</li>\n<li>Launch Aperture, select the project in question and give Aperture some time to re-process the photos.</li>\n<li>If the desired changes have been applied correctly and Aperture doesn't show any errors or wrong EXIF information, delete the backup files.</li>\n</ol>\n",

With Simple Passcode on you will set a 4-digit number, with it off you can set a longer alphanumeric passcode.

It also helped me remember the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/colorburn.html\">Color Burn Widget</a> which I lost during an OS upgrade.<br></p><p>There are two widgets I'd like to add to that list, though:</p><p><a href=\"http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/introducing-loremify/\">Loremify</a> ‚Äî a one-click Lorem Ipsum generator, and<br><a href=\"http://junecloud.com/software/mac/delivery-status.html\">Delivery Status</a> ‚Äî the best parcel tracking widget out there.<br></p><p>Oh and everybody always forgets about the built-in widgets, so; multiple weather widgets, a few world clocks and the unit conversion widget never leave my dashboard.</p>\n",

				"title": "The WWDC 2012 keynote was a massacre",
				"content_html": "<p><p>Another WWDC keynote in the bag. And what a behemoth of a keynote it has been. Not having had time to follow live blogs, I caught up on the announcements through the Apple‚Äôs video of the event and by reading up on the details on Apple.com and other good sites.<br>I know I&rsquo;m late to the game with my keynote recap, but there were many interesting software announcements too good not to be discussed.</p><p></p><p>My overall impression of the event and the announcements was that Apple is flexing its muscles. One major new hardware release, many minor revisions and upgrades and two OS updates at once. This should give the competition a glimpse at what Apple is capable of today, most even likely not even beginning to stretch their resources.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the rundown of the features I&rsquo;m most excited about:</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>iOS 6</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/\" target=\"_blank\">Siri</a> only available on the 3rd gen. iPad ‚Äî This is kind of a bummer, but it‚Äôs in line with Apple‚Äôs product strategy, meaning it was to be expected and is probably hardware-related, at least to some degree.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#facebook\">Facebook integration</a>: DUH!</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#maps\">Maps</a> look simply beautiful, but having to compete against Google Maps and Google Earth is not going to be easy; Apple has their work cut out for them. The application will put pressure on developers of Turn-by-Turn Navigation apps, because just like on Android, the solution integrated into the OS might be sufficient for many people.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#photostreams\">Shared Photo Streams</a> is a neat way to privately share photos without having to upload them to a social network. From the looks of it, the minimal design puts the content first and further sharing options second.</li><li><a href=\"#\">Passbook</a> is our answer to how Apple thinks mobile payments should look like. I don‚Äôt see NFC appearing in Apple‚Äôs devices anytime soon.</li><li>The new features in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#phone\">phone application UI</a> were long overdue. Android has had them for years and they‚Äôve even existed in not so smart phones ‚Äî those with memories that go back further than four years might remember.</li><li>I like the better handling of Messages across devices. When someone sends an iMessage to my phone number, I‚Äôm now going to receive it on my iPad and Mac, too. Great!</li><li>This one I‚Äôm extremely excited about, the Do Not Disturb feature. Seriously, what took them so long? Finally (yes, I said it) I won‚Äôt have to put my phone into Airplane Mode at night to have peace and quiet. Extra props for the fine tuned options.</li><li>I didn‚Äôt see Google show up in the search fields of iOS devices, only a generic &lsquo;Search&rsquo; term. Might there be a chance for additional search engines besides Google, Bing and Yahoo? I‚Äôm talking about DuckDuckGo of course. I‚Äôm trying hard not to get my hopes up.</li><li>The new store designs and China-centric features are appreciated.</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>OS X Mountain Lion</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/\">10.8‚Äôs pricing and upgrade conditions</a> are a thing of beauty. Microsoft should slowly start to get the drift.</li><li>Tighter <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#icloud\">iCloud</a> integration should‚Äôve been there in Lion, but maybe I‚Äôm the only one who thinks that way. Easier machine setup is a good thing, though.</li><li>At this point, the built-in <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#reminders\">Reminders</a> app in iOS has replaced Things (by Cultured Code) for me. The implementation on the Mac (inside of iCal) has been far from good, but a native OS X Reminders app is going to make this complaint a thing of the past.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#notification\">Notification Center</a> is a very welcome addition, but I‚Äôm interested to see what kind of apps will be able to take advantage of its APIs; only Mac App Store apps, or any kind of app?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#powernap\">Power Nap</a> is a very interesting and potentially useful feature. From what Apple states as the system requirement for it, though, you‚Äôll need a Mac with flash storage. I wonder if it‚Äôll work with Macs that‚Äôve been retrofitted with SSDs?</li><li>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dictation\">Dictation</a> feature will be an absolute productivity boon ‚Äî especially with my Master‚Äôs Thesis looming on the horizon! I hope they‚Äôve integrated some kind of fast language switching for this OS feature, because I‚Äôm definitely going to hop between English and German a lot.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Sharing</a> looks nice and I‚Äôm hoping for a public API so other services can make use of this ‚Äî I just want to get rid of all those bookmarklets in my browser‚Äôs bookmark bar.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Safari</a> has received some good upgrades: Apple finally (yes, I said it again) got rid of the separate search box. Now, how about letting me set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine? The tab view is interesting, too, and iCloud tabs will surely come in handy. Apple‚Äôs attempting to improve password handling in OS X, let‚Äôs see how it compares to the likes of 1Password for regular users. The ‚ÄûDo Not Track‚Äú feature and the ability to rename bookmarks in the bookmarks bar are welcome additions as well.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#autosave\">Auto Save</a> has been taught two nice new tricks, too: It automatically moves untitled documents to iCloud and APPLE BROUGHT BACK ‚ÄûSAVE AS‚Äú! YAY! No seriously, I still need this feature rather often.</li><li>The oh-so benevolent Apple has decided that a permanently displayed <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#calendar\">Calendar</a> sidebar is a good thing after all, same as a groups column in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#contacts\">Contacts</a> app and they improved the date picker. Regarding the first two: Why the hell did they remove it in the first place?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dashboard\">Dashboard</a>: It just won‚Äôt die.

				"content_text": "<p>Another WWDC keynote in the bag. And what a behemoth of a keynote it has been. Not having had time to follow live blogs, I caught up on the announcements through the Apple‚Äôs video of the event and by reading up on the details on Apple.com and other good sites.<br>I know I'm late to the game with my keynote recap, but there were many interesting software announcements too good not to be discussed.</p><p></p><p>My overall impression of the event and the announcements was that Apple is flexing its muscles. One major new hardware release, many minor revisions and upgrades and two OS updates at once. This should give the competition a glimpse at what Apple is capable of today, most even likely not even beginning to stretch their resources.</p><p>Here's the rundown of the features I'm most excited about:</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>iOS 6</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/\" target=\"_blank\">Siri</a> only available on the 3rd gen. iPad ‚Äî This is kind of a bummer, but it‚Äôs in line with Apple‚Äôs product strategy, meaning it was to be expected and is probably hardware-related, at least to some degree.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#facebook\">Facebook integration</a>: DUH!</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#maps\">Maps</a> look simply beautiful, but having to compete against Google Maps and Google Earth is not going to be easy; Apple has their work cut out for them. The application will put pressure on developers of Turn-by-Turn Navigation apps, because just like on Android, the solution integrated into the OS might be sufficient for many people.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#photostreams\">Shared Photo Streams</a> is a neat way to privately share photos without having to upload them to a social network. From the looks of it, the minimal design puts the content first and further sharing options second.</li><li><a href=\"#\">Passbook</a> is our answer to how Apple thinks mobile payments should look like. I don‚Äôt see NFC appearing in Apple‚Äôs devices anytime soon.</li><li>The new features in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#phone\">phone application UI</a> were long overdue. Android has had them for years and they‚Äôve even existed in not so smart phones ‚Äî those with memories that go back further than four years might remember.</li><li>I like the better handling of Messages across devices. When someone sends an iMessage to my phone number, I‚Äôm now going to receive it on my iPad and Mac, too. Great!</li><li>This one I‚Äôm extremely excited about, the Do Not Disturb feature. Seriously, what took them so long? Finally (yes, I said it) I won‚Äôt have to put my phone into Airplane Mode at night to have peace and quiet. Extra props for the fine tuned options.</li><li>I didn‚Äôt see Google show up in the search fields of iOS devices, only a generic 'Search' term. Might there be a chance for additional search engines besides Google, Bing and Yahoo? I‚Äôm talking about DuckDuckGo of course. I‚Äôm trying hard not to get my hopes up.</li><li>The new store designs and China-centric features are appreciated.</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>OS X Mountain Lion</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/\">10.8‚Äôs pricing and upgrade conditions</a> are a thing of beauty. Microsoft should slowly start to get the drift.</li><li>Tighter <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#icloud\">iCloud</a> integration should‚Äôve been there in Lion, but maybe I‚Äôm the only one who thinks that way. Easier machine setup is a good thing, though.</li><li>At this point, the built-in <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#reminders\">Reminders</a> app in iOS has replaced Things (by Cultured Code) for me. The implementation on the Mac (inside of iCal) has been far from good, but a native OS X Reminders app is going to make this complaint a thing of the past.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#notification\">Notification Center</a> is a very welcome addition, but I‚Äôm interested to see what kind of apps will be able to take advantage of its APIs; only Mac App Store apps, or any kind of app?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#powernap\">Power Nap</a> is a very interesting and potentially useful feature. From what Apple states as the system requirement for it, though, you‚Äôll need a Mac with flash storage. I wonder if it‚Äôll work with Macs that‚Äôve been retrofitted with SSDs?</li><li>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dictation\">Dictation</a> feature will be an absolute productivity boon ‚Äî especially with my Master‚Äôs Thesis looming on the horizon! I hope they‚Äôve integrated some kind of fast language switching for this OS feature, because I‚Äôm definitely going to hop between English and German a lot.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Sharing</a> looks nice and I‚Äôm hoping for a public API so other services can make use of this ‚Äî I just want to get rid of all those bookmarklets in my browser‚Äôs bookmark bar.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#safari\">Safari</a> has received some good upgrades: Apple finally (yes, I said it again) got rid of the separate search box. Now, how about letting me set DuckDuckGo as my default search engine? The tab view is interesting, too, and iCloud tabs will surely come in handy. Apple‚Äôs attempting to improve password handling in OS X, let‚Äôs see how it compares to the likes of 1Password for regular users. The ‚ÄûDo Not Track‚Äú feature and the ability to rename bookmarks in the bookmarks bar are welcome additions as well.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#autosave\">Auto Save</a> has been taught two nice new tricks, too: It automatically moves untitled documents to iCloud and APPLE BROUGHT BACK ‚ÄûSAVE AS‚Äú! YAY! No seriously, I still need this feature rather often.</li><li>The oh-so benevolent Apple has decided that a permanently displayed <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#calendar\">Calendar</a> sidebar is a good thing after all, same as a groups column in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#contacts\">Contacts</a> app and they improved the date picker. Regarding the first two: Why the hell did they remove it in the first place?</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dashboard\">Dashboard</a>: It just won‚Äôt die. Persistent little fella. Personally, I like Dashboard and would be sad to see it go.</li><li>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#appstore\">OS X Software Update</a> feature and the Mac App Store are rolled into one app. I consider this to be a good thing. Equally good is the automatic download of and notification about software updates both for the OS and Mac App Store applications.</li><li>Mail, Mail, Mail, oh <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#mail\">Mail</a>. Tighter iCloud integration FTW I say, because the app (here we go for a thrid time) finally pushes recent senders, favorites, signatures, flag names, smart mailboxes, mail rules, and account information to all devices.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#quicktime\">Quicktime X</a> now uses hardware video encoding for H.264 content on newer Macs. I wonder if this‚Äôll be somehow usable by other applications? But it neat in any case.</li></ul>\n",

Pictured above is the flight deck of Space Shuttle Endeavour, the youngest shuttle and the second to last ever launched. The numerous panels and displays allowed the computer-controlled orbiter to enter the top of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at greater than the speed of sound and &ndash; just thirty minutes later &ndash; land on a runway like an airplane. The retired space shuttles are now being sent to museums, with Endeavour being sent to California Space Center in Los Angeles, California, Atlantis to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on Merritt Island, Florida, and Discovery to the Udvar-Hazy Annex of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia.

No, teachers can‚Äôt lead children in prayer‚Äîyou may recall the establishment of religion clause, Governor Perry‚Äîbut that didn‚Äôt stop a group of Christian students from gathering around the flagpole of my high school to pray several times a week.</p>\n<p>Rick Perry is the same presidential candidate who yesterday said that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/rick-perry-says-human-rights-for-gays-not-in-americas-interests/\" target=\"_blank\">improving the lives of gay individuals abroad was ‚Äúnot in America‚Äôs interests‚Äù</a> and suggested that <em>not being killed or imprisoned</em> in nations like Uganda is a ‚Äúspecial right‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd really like to hear Rick Perry explain why it‚Äôs okay to burn <a href=\"http://costofwar.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">over a trillion dollars</a> to kill brown people overseas, ostensibly to prevent them from killing people, but it‚Äôs not okay to make American aid to foreign countries conditional on those countries not killing or imprisoning their own citizens based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Somehow I doubt Jesus would agree with Governor Perry‚Äôs priorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúReligious heritage‚Äù???</p>\n<p>Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the Pilgrim Fathers came to ‚ÄòThe New World‚Äô because of religious persecution and the wish for religious freedom.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I think someone should slap him with the First Amendment until he understands it ‚Äî and not only the parts regarding religious freedom, but also those on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and interference with the right to peaceably assemble.</p>\n<p>One last thing: Could this man be kindly reeducated on one of the pillars of modern democracy? It‚Äôs called¬†<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state\" target=\"_blank\">‚ÄòThe Separation of State and Church‚Äô</a>.<br/>A quick quote from Thomas Jefferson:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‚Äòmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,‚Äô thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.‚Äù¬†</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this guy gets elected president he might put the Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades to shame. I‚Äôm German‚Äîbrought-up strictly catholic, turned agnostic‚Äîand I cannot do anything against scum like him, but¬†<strong>crap</strong>¬†like this video makes my blood boil.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><div class=\"sqs-link\"><a href=\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\" target=\"_blank\">David Chartier on Shit work and technocentrism</a></div><p><a href=\"http://windonaleaf.net/post/12298687022/shit-work-and-technocentrism\" target=\"_blank\">chartier</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zach Holman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with shit work is that no one likes doing it, but an awful lot of people say they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with almost everything in this piece. It‚Äôs based entirely on one core assumption that is wrong in so many ways, I told Siri to set a timer for how long I can take to respond to this.</p>\n<p>Holman hates managing Twitter lists, Google+ circles, email folders, and task priorities, and leans on a couple anecdotes and process-alergic indie contractor Merlin Mann to argue that no one actually gets any value out of doing these things. That‚Äôs fine for the people who don‚Äôt really get these things, or those who don‚Äôt work in an environment where they are ever necessary. But a lot of people <em>do</em> get value from these processes in a variety of ways, from simple entertainment, to maintaining privacy while sharing online (which Holman shrugs off), to staying on top of crazy work schedules and informed on current events. Aside from the inevitable edge case examples, developers aren‚Äôt spending all this time on features no one asked for.</p>\n<p>One of Holman‚Äôs punching bags is Twitter lists. He doesn‚Äôt like them, doesn‚Äôt see the point, and doesn‚Äôt know anyone who thinks otherwise. I love and increasingly use Twitter lists, and I personally know a bunch of people who do as well. Stepping beyond my single anecdote, though, you don‚Äôt have to spend much time to find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mashable/lists\" target=\"_blank\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/4437400/Telegraph-Twitter-feeds-Who-to-follow-to-get-the-latest-news-reviews-and-pictures-straight-to-your-feed.html\" target=\"_blank\">others</a> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Favstar/lists\" target=\"_blank\">do as well</a>. I also found <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\" target=\"_blank\">great</a> Twitter <a href=\"http://www.stone.com/tweettv/\" target=\"_blank\">clients</a> that do good things with lists and make them easy to use, and isn‚Äôt that half the challenge almost any work imaginable? If your tools suck, doing the work will likely suck.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt need to trudge through every one of Holman‚Äôs ‚Äúshit work‚Äù examples for you to get the picture. Just because you or like Merlin Mann doesn‚Äôt get or like a process doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no value in it, or that it‚Äôs ‚Äúshit work.‚Äù Plus, leaning on a couple anecdotes to judge the big picture is just plain lazy. Writing these processes off because you don‚Äôt get them or don‚Äôt work in an environment where they can be useful is arrogant and ethnocentric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the post by Mr. Holman and I came to a similar conclusion. If Mr. Holman doesn‚Äôt like those tools, fine, but writing them off because of it, is self-centered punditry that we can do without.\n<br/>It‚Äôs black-and-white thinking of the highest (lowest?) order: ‚ÄúIf a tools isn‚Äôt perfect from the get-go, the way <i>I</i> want it, it is shit altogether and nobody should even try to make it useful for them!‚Äù</p>\n<p>To be clear: I don‚Äôt cherish the fact that I sometimes have to sit down and sort people into Twitter or Facebook lists. But the 15 minutes I spend doing this increase the value of both tools immensly for me. Same goes for RSS feeds; fairly regularly I weed through them, checking which ones are still worth reading and which aren‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples:\n</p><ul><li>Twitter lists: While I don‚Äôt follow many people, I have a few key lists set-up. One of those is a list of friends and people whose opinion I value. Using this list in <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetbot</a>, I can quickly catch-up on recent happenings and discussions when I don‚Äôt want to go through 10 hours of my timeline.\n<br/>Mr. Holman might object by saying that this isn‚Äôt the way to use Twitter.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-link\"><a href=\"http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/\" target=\"_blank\">David Chartier on Shit work and technocentrism</a></div><p><a href=\"http://windonaleaf.net/post/12298687022/shit-work-and-technocentrism\" target=\"_blank\">chartier</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zach Holman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with shit work is that no one likes doing it, but an awful lot of people say they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with almost everything in this piece. It‚Äôs based entirely on one core assumption that is wrong in so many ways, I told Siri to set a timer for how long I can take to respond to this.</p>\n<p>Holman hates managing Twitter lists, Google+ circles, email folders, and task priorities, and leans on a couple anecdotes and process-alergic indie contractor Merlin Mann to argue that no one actually gets any value out of doing these things. That‚Äôs fine for the people who don‚Äôt really get these things, or those who don‚Äôt work in an environment where they are ever necessary. But a lot of people <em>do</em> get value from these processes in a variety of ways, from simple entertainment, to maintaining privacy while sharing online (which Holman shrugs off), to staying on top of crazy work schedules and informed on current events. Aside from the inevitable edge case examples, developers aren‚Äôt spending all this time on features no one asked for.</p>\n<p>One of Holman‚Äôs punching bags is Twitter lists. He doesn‚Äôt like them, doesn‚Äôt see the point, and doesn‚Äôt know anyone who thinks otherwise. I love and increasingly use Twitter lists, and I personally know a bunch of people who do as well. Stepping beyond my single anecdote, though, you don‚Äôt have to spend much time to find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mashable/lists\" target=\"_blank\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/4437400/Telegraph-Twitter-feeds-Who-to-follow-to-get-the-latest-news-reviews-and-pictures-straight-to-your-feed.html\" target=\"_blank\">others</a> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Favstar/lists\" target=\"_blank\">do as well</a>. I also found <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\" target=\"_blank\">great</a> Twitter <a href=\"http://www.stone.com/tweettv/\" target=\"_blank\">clients</a> that do good things with lists and make them easy to use, and isn‚Äôt that half the challenge almost any work imaginable? If your tools suck, doing the work will likely suck.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt need to trudge through every one of Holman‚Äôs ‚Äúshit work‚Äù examples for you to get the picture. Just because you or like Merlin Mann doesn‚Äôt get or like a process doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no value in it, or that it‚Äôs ‚Äúshit work.‚Äù Plus, leaning on a couple anecdotes to judge the big picture is just plain lazy. Writing these processes off because you don‚Äôt get them or don‚Äôt work in an environment where they can be useful is arrogant and ethnocentric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the post by Mr. Holman and I came to a similar conclusion. If Mr. Holman doesn‚Äôt like those tools, fine, but writing them off because of it, is self-centered punditry that we can do without.\n<br/>It‚Äôs black-and-white thinking of the highest (lowest?) order: ‚ÄúIf a tools isn‚Äôt perfect from the get-go, the way <i>I</i> want it, it is shit altogether and nobody should even try to make it useful for them!‚Äù</p>\n<p>To be clear: I don‚Äôt cherish the fact that I sometimes have to sit down and sort people into Twitter or Facebook lists. But the 15 minutes I spend doing this increase the value of both tools immensly for me. Same goes for RSS feeds; fairly regularly I weed through them, checking which ones are still worth reading and which aren‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples:\n</p><ul><li>Twitter lists: While I don‚Äôt follow many people, I have a few key lists set-up. One of those is a list of friends and people whose opinion I value. Using this list in <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetbot</a>, I can quickly catch-up on recent happenings and discussions when I don‚Äôt want to go through 10 hours of my timeline.\n<br/>Mr. Holman might object by saying that this isn‚Äôt the way to use Twitter. Who in their right mind will spend time reading tweets so far back? Well, I sometimes do.</li>\n<li>Facebook‚Äôs new subscription feature: This is one of the most welcome additions to the service for me so far, because it allows me to select whose updates appear in my timeline.

Apple could falter. If all that happens, I‚Äôll be happy to switch again. I have no unreasonable loyalty to Apple. I‚Äôm just a satisfied customer.</p>\n<p>But my story should be a cautionary tale for the entire industry. At this particular moment, Apple has struck upon a devastating strategy for taking control of the consumer electronics industry and mainstream computing: Build simple, elegant, functional and beautiful devices at all points in the consumer electronics chain.

Apple could falter. If all that happens, I‚Äôll be happy to switch again. I have no unreasonable loyalty to Apple. I‚Äôm just a satisfied customer.</p>\n<p>But my story should be a cautionary tale for the entire industry. At this particular moment, Apple has struck upon a devastating strategy for taking control of the consumer electronics industry and mainstream computing: Build simple, elegant, functional and beautiful devices at all points in the consumer electronics chain.

The reason you rationalise it as something you feel because they get more help or rights than you is two-fold:</p>\n<ol><li>You‚Äôre smart enough and educated enough to know that you‚Äôre in the wrong on this, so you‚Äôve reached for something that will allow you to continue being a bigoted jerk anyway.</li>\n<li>Your friends are smart enough and educated enough to know that you‚Äôre in the wrong on this, so you‚Äôve reached for something that will allow you to con‚Ä¶ oh, wait, this is actually the exact same reason.</li>\n</ol><p>Speaking as a straight cis white man from, I can absolutely guarantee you that you‚Äôre wrong about getting financial aid. Without financial aid from my government and my college, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone to college. If you want to go to college, and you got the grades you say you did, you can go to college. Trust me on this one.</p>\n<p>But let‚Äôs deal with the substance of your post, because‚Ä¶ well, because it makes me furious. You feel like you‚Äôre being hosed, and I get that; I really do. It‚Äôs <em>terrible </em>that your people weren‚Äôt killed in probably the most massive genocide the world has ever seen. It‚Äôs <em>awful</em> that no one committed germ warfare against your ancestors, stole their land, marched them hundreds or thousands of miles, and gave them back a tiny bit of their own land to live on (along with widespread substance addiction). It totally sucks for you that your race isn‚Äôt used as a mascot by sports teams or used as a placeholder for ‚Äúnoble savagery‚Äù on dozens of TV shows every year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I‚Äôm sorry that the American government doesn‚Äôt exist purely to make sure that you personally get free money, even though it did make sure that you got a world-class education. Hell, you even knew enough to use the word ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù as a barb. I‚Äôm impressed. But I‚Äôm not sympathetic. Look around you. You have everything you need to further your education already.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR version: The world doesn‚Äôt owe you a goddamned thing. Go work for it, and stop complaining that people who‚Äôve been fucked over for generations have it worse than you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This guy is a textbook example of an entitletard.</p>\n",

WHY AM I SUFFERING BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID MISTAKES MADE BY PEOPLE FROM HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO? DROP IT ALREADY. DROP IT AND I‚ÄôLL DROP MY DAMNED HATE. I HATE THE TREATIES. I HATE NATIVES. I HATE THAT THEY ARE SPECIAL AND YOU HAND THEM EVERYTHING.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúGet good enough marks and you can have scholarships!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Well thanks a fucking lot. I guess having a lowest mark of 94% in my LAST semester of high school wasn‚Äôt good enough. I guess my 99% in history wasn‚Äôt good enough.¬†</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and to the friend that can‚Äôt even bother to fucking try and talk me through this and instead assumes I‚Äôm ‚Äútaking my frustration out on Native people.‚Äù Fuck you too. I don‚Äôt even have a CHANCE to apply for SHIT from the government. They don‚Äôt have scholarships for students that are white anymore. There are programs ONLY for natives. Don‚Äôt tell me I don‚Äôt know anything. I‚Äôve seen enough to know you guys are HANDED STUFF. MAYBE I DON‚ÄôT FUCKING KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT I KNOW ENOUGH. Know what the government will give me? MAYBE two hundred bucks a month. IF I get a student loan. IF I am low income. IF IF IF. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IT.¬†</p>\n<p>Now I‚Äôm sobbing. If there are people that can‚Äôt fucking take my rants, forget about being my friend. I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôm tired of working hard not to be rewarded. What the hell is the point of working so much if it won‚Äôt make a fucking difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt even have words for what I‚Äôm feeling right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No worries, I‚Äôve got this.</p>\n<p>The reason you ‚Äústruggle with hatred against natives‚Äù is because you have an irrational dislike (probably passed through your family) for a different group of people. The reason you rationalise it as something you feel because they get more help or rights than you is two-fold:</p>\n<ol><li>You‚Äôre smart enough and educated enough to know that you‚Äôre in the wrong on this, so you‚Äôve reached for something that will allow you to continue being a bigoted jerk anyway.</li>\n<li>Your friends are smart enough and educated enough to know that you‚Äôre in the wrong on this, so you‚Äôve reached for something that will allow you to con‚Ä¶ oh, wait, this is actually the exact same reason.</li>\n</ol><p>Speaking as a straight cis white man from, I can absolutely guarantee you that you‚Äôre wrong about getting financial aid. Without financial aid from my government and my college, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone to college. If you want to go to college, and you got the grades you say you did, you can go to college. Trust me on this one.</p>\n<p>But let‚Äôs deal with the substance of your post, because‚Ä¶ well, because it makes me furious. You feel like you‚Äôre being hosed, and I get that; I really do. It‚Äôs <em>terrible </em>that your people weren‚Äôt killed in probably the most massive genocide the world has ever seen. It‚Äôs <em>awful</em> that no one committed germ warfare against your ancestors, stole their land, marched them hundreds or thousands of miles, and gave them back a tiny bit of their own land to live on (along with widespread substance addiction). It totally sucks for you that your race isn‚Äôt used as a mascot by sports teams or used as a placeholder for ‚Äúnoble savagery‚Äù on dozens of TV shows every year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I‚Äôm sorry that the American government doesn‚Äôt exist purely to make sure that you personally get free money, even though it did make sure that you got a world-class education. Hell, you even knew enough to use the word ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù as a barb. I‚Äôm impressed. But I‚Äôm not sympathetic. Look around you. You have everything you need to further your education already.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR version: The world doesn‚Äôt owe you a goddamned thing. Go work for it, and stop complaining that people who‚Äôve been fucked over for generations have it worse than you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This guy is a textbook example of an entitletard.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/apples-iphone-probleme-die-grenzen-des-schweigens-1.976419\">Die Sueddeutsche ignoriert Kritik genauso sehr wie Apple</a><p>In diesem Artikel wird eindrucksvoll dargestellt, dass die Redakteure der S√ºddeutschen weder technisches Verst√§ndnis besitzen, noch den Willen, die Inhalte einer Pressekonferenz von Apple korrekt wiederzugeben, solange es die Besucherzahlen der Seite hoch h√§lt. Einige Beispiele im einzelnen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple verwandelt seine iPhone-Antennenprobleme in eine Marketing-Veranstaltung.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bereits dieser Satz im Teaser geht an dem vorbei was in der Pressekonferenz bei Apple behandelt wurde. Nach allen vorliegenden Daten besteht ein Problem mit der Antenne, welches einen sehr kleinen Prozentsatz der Nutzer betrifft und von Apple untersucht wird.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So verlor sich die vielleicht einflussreichste Figur des Silicon Valley denn auch in Rechtfertigungsphrasen.

				"content_text": "[Die Sueddeutsche ignoriert Kritik genauso sehr wie Apple](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/apples-iphone-probleme-die-grenzen-des-schweigens-1.976419)<p>In diesem Artikel wird eindrucksvoll dargestellt, dass die Redakteure der S√ºddeutschen weder technisches Verst√§ndnis besitzen, noch den Willen, die Inhalte einer Pressekonferenz von Apple korrekt wiederzugeben, solange es die Besucherzahlen der Seite hoch h√§lt. Einige Beispiele im einzelnen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple verwandelt seine iPhone-Antennenprobleme in eine Marketing-Veranstaltung.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bereits dieser Satz im Teaser geht an dem vorbei was in der Pressekonferenz bei Apple behandelt wurde. Nach allen vorliegenden Daten besteht ein Problem mit der Antenne, welches einen sehr kleinen Prozentsatz der Nutzer betrifft und von Apple untersucht wird.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So verlor sich die vielleicht einflussreichste Figur des Silicon Valley denn auch in Rechtfertigungsphrasen.
