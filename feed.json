Tyler Benedict praised the bike for not just feeling fast because of it but being confident and stable at speed thanks to this geometry.</p>\n<p>Reading this is all made sense and I believe we‘re going to see more of it but when I arrived at the geometry table, the values seemed familiar. I opened the Van Nicholas home page, found the Yukon Disc and wouldn’t you know it: my bike has highly comparable values.

To the left and right a simple wooden railing sits atop the edges of a canal passing under the gravel road. A titanium gravel bike with dusty slick tyres, photographed from the back, is leaning against the railing on the right.\")\n\nSo far going for an „all road“ bike seems to have been exactly what I was looking for. I don’t plan on tackling the kinds of rides with it that I have my XC mountain bike for but I’m also not limited to planning routes in Komoot locked in to the „road bike“ category; „bike“ works perfectly fine and I know it won’t throw anything at me that I can’t handle on this bike with slick tyres. \n\nThe frame and fork can take up to a 35 mm wide rubber and I’ve already done a couple of proper gravel rides using DT Swiss CR1600 wheels shod with Schwalbe X-One 33 mm tubeless tyres. Now _that_ was a bunch of fun and it’s the setup I plan on using for this year’s [Gravel Rallye Rhine Valley](https://gravel-rallye.com/rhine-valley/).\n\n![Drive side view of a titanium gravel bike leaning against a white and grey house wall. The bike has narrow section aluminium wheels and off-road tyres meant for cyclocross. The bike and saddle bag are dusty from a dry-weather off-road ride.](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-f8pz7qZ/0/33fbbc9d/4K/i-f8pz7qZ-4K.jpg \"Drive side view of a titanium gravel bike leaning against a white and grey house wall.

The bike and saddle bag are dusty from a dry-weather off-road ride.\")\n\nFor many cyclists [n+1](https://road.cc/content/feature/do-you-really-need-another-bike-find-out-what-n1-means-289875) is a reality and I don’t want to claim to be an exception – my stupid brain is already thinking of what fun thing to do with the Veloheld frame set … maybe a flat bar gravel bike? I can honestly say that I’m enjoying this bike more than I would’ve thought possible and something really groundbreaking would have to come along to get me to even think of replacing it.\n",
